According to not very reliable data it was noted that the earthquake was accompanied by tsunami waves which were seen mostly on the south-western, southern and south-eastern coasts of the island: in Kition, Paphos, Salamis (Ref #2130).\r\n<p>76 A.D. Cyprus, Kition, Paphos and Salamis. Doubtful event based solely on a misinterpretation by Oberhummer of an allegorical statement in the Sibylline Oracles. Correct translation of Greek text indicates storm sea-waves, not\r\nuncommon in Cyprus. Contemporary and later writers do not mention seismic sea-wave in 76 A.D. (reference #15)\r\n</p><p>76 A.D. Cyprus, Kition, Paphos and Salamis. (reference #20)\r\n</p><p>76 A.D. Cyprus, Cition, Paphos and Salamis. A disastrous earthquake occurred in Cyprus in 76 or 77 AD. This earthquake is generally dated together with a pestilence in\r\nRome, in 77 AD, but early chroniclers differ in it slightly. We are inclined to think rather of 76 AD as the year for this earthquake because this was the year at which the Romans transferred their mint to Cyprus and the first coins minted there are dated July 76, August 77 and September 78. It is not improbable that this transfer of the mint was connected with the measures taken to relieve the island after the earthquake which is generally dated 767 AD but may have taken place a year earlier. Some few early chroniclers may have put the earthquake in 77 AD in order to synchronise it with the pestilence in Rome.\r\n</p><p>The facts about the particular places in Cyprus which were destroyed by this earthquake and the seismic sea-wave which is supposed to have accompanied this earthquake, are very obscure. \r\n</p><p>If we trust the allusion in the Sibyllina Oracula, the places in Cyprus which suffered most should have been Salamis, Paphos and Cition, but it is questionable whether these places suffered from the 76 AD earthquake or from a later shock. It seams probable, from the slight indications,\r\nmostly inferences from statements at a later date, that,\r\nwith the possible exception of Cition, Salamis and Paphos should lave been damaged to some extent by the 76 AD earthquake. The chroniclers were evidently not quite certain of the particular places in Cyprus which were damaged by this earthquake.\r\n</p><p>The Sibyllina Oracula prophesies also a destructive seismic seawave. This prophesy constitutes the sole authority upon which Oberhummer and after him many authors have based their arguments for the 76 AD seismic sea-wave in Cyprus. But we find no mention of such an event in the narrations of early chroniclers, and we feel that should an event such as a catastrophic seismic sea-wave had in fact accompanied this earthquake, it should have been most certainly included by these chroniclers in their description of the seismic events of 76 AD.\r\n</p><p>Whether, in this instance, the Sibyllina Oracula can be trusted as a source of authentic historical information, and if so, whether the seismic sea-wave in Cyprus which is mentioned in the text refers to the earthquake of 76 AD, all yet remains to be investigated. No other data worthy of any confidence has come to our attention. \r\n</p><p>(above from reference #23)\r\n</p><p>It is probably that the earthquake [76 AD] was associated with a seismic sea wave at Salamis and Paphos but it is not certain whether this was the result of this or of another earthquake.

The sky was illuminated like day-time. A little later, people, panic-stricken by the violent trembling, were lying on the ground; some were buried under fallen houses and others inside wide-opened ground fissures, while horses and cows desperately ran about and trampled each other. A number of castles, towers, and other tall structures collapsed. Then roarings like thunder were heard towards the sea. The sea soon rushed into the villages and towns, over-whelming a few hundred miles of land along the coast. There was scarcely any time for escape, though there were boats and the high ground just before them. In this way about 1000 people were killed. Hundreds of hamlets and villages were left in ruins.&#34; (Imamura, 1934). This earthquake is suggested to be one of the predecessors of the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake (e.g., Sawai et al., 2015). The magnitude and source region of the 869 earthquake were re-evaluated (e.g., Sugawara et al., 2012; Namegaya and Satake, 2014) using the insights obtained from the 2011 tsunami.

Like Lima, Callao consisted mostly of single-storey houses on a low-terrace, whose height was no greater than 3 m (9-10 feet) above the high water mark. The town was enclosed by a fortress wall, whose base was sometimes washed by the strong ocean tides. Normally, the water level at Callao rises 1.4 m (4-5 feet). Up to 5000 persons lived in the town. Callao was damaged by the earthquake to the same degree as Lima. Approximately one half hour after the earthquake, the ocean &#34;swelled&#34;, rose approximately 10 m, smashed the city wall and inundated the city. When the water receded the majority of houses and other buildings were dislodged from their foundations and washed away. A sizeable portion of the city wall, including the gate, had been carried away by the water. Almost the entire population of the town perished in this disaster. Since the water advanced 4 km inland, it overtook even those who had tried to flee to Lima.

The course of events was this: <p>\r\n...I noticed that also from the water there arose enormous columns of sand and ashes, which ascended in the shape of pyramids to marvelous heights and then fell back into the lake like illuminated fountains.</p><p>Some of the pyramids surged toward north, others toward east, the sight lasting until 9 o&#39;clock of the morning. At the latter hour there was felt a furious earthquake which left nothing moveable in\r\nits place within the convento. This forced me to flee to higher ground, especially as I noticed that some of the horrid pyramids shooting forth from the water were coming toward the town and place where we were. When they reached that part of the lake&#39;s shore which was known as &#34;tierra destruida&#34; [waste land?], they ruined that tract entirely, and with a second earthquake, not less fierce than the one\r\nshortly preceding, it sank into the lake. To this very day, the branches of the trees buried beneath the water can be seen from the distance. </p><p>During these terrible convulsions of the earth fissures opened in the ground amid horrifying roars, said fissures extending from the northern and northeastern beach of the lake as far as the neighborhood of the town of Calamba. Here as well as elsewhere, the whole shore of Lake Bombon has been disturbed. The entire territory of Sala and part of that of Tanauan have been rendered practically uninhabitable-the water courses have been altered, former springs have ceased to flow and new ones made their appearance, the whole country is traversed by fissures, and extensive subsidences have occurred in many places. </p><p>Sala and its surroundings to the northeast of the lake, as well as, a portion of the territory of Tanauan, which is north of it, were so thoroughly ruined and, consequently, depopulated that within the same year, 1749, the former was united with the latter town.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #2340)\r\n</p><p>[...]the origin of the waves observed during the 1749 eruption remains unclear. This violent phreatomagmatic eruption (VEI 4) lasted three months and severely impacted the northern and northeastern shores of the lake (Delos Reyes et al. 2018). One earthquake led to land subsidence in the northeastern part of the caldera (near Tanauan). Explosions were located in the main crater of Taal Island (Fig. 1), with a possible extension to coastal or sublacustrine vents near the northeastern point of the island. (reference#12533)</p>",

It destroyed almost the entire city and was felt strongly at Mexico City. The source of the earthquake was apparently situated near Acapulco and San Marcos. The earthquake gave rise to a large tsunami. The sea at Acapulco suddenly retreated, dropping a vessel riding at anchor on the bottom of the bay. The flood tide was stronger than in 1732. The rise of water passed the maximal flood tide mark by 3-4 m. The tsunami damaged the citadel and the fortress walls and destroyed most of the homes in the city. (reference #415)\r\n<p>1754, Sept 1. The origin of the earthquake was located near Acapulco, Gro., and San Mmos and it was felt in\r\nMexico City.

During the late afternoon, there was another earthquake, which though weaker than the first, still caused fear and agitation. These effects were produced by a large, probably intermediate-depth event with an epicentre off Crete, where many places were destroyed and many people killed. All the other islands in the southern part of the Archipelago suffered some damage. In Malta, the shock caused panic, and widespread minor damage in Valletta, where ships in the harbour were violently shaken. The effects extended to Syria; in Lattakia, it is related that ancient buildings that had previously been swallowed up were seen at the bottom of a chasm, before it closed up again. The shock was also felt in central Italy, Turkey, Cyprus and various parts of North Africa. Minor damage was reported from Rashid (Rosetta) and Alexandria, where the earthquake set up waves in the harbour and in canals. The shock was probably also strongly felt in the Siwa oasis.

There was a destructive earthquake on the southwest of the Philippine Islands, with a maximum intensity of VIII (IX Rossi-Forel). \r\n</p><p>The steamship &#34;Brutus&#34;, situated near Zamboanga, felt a strong seaquake. Waves arose, moving to the east and breaking on shore near Zamboanga about 10 minutes later.\r\n</p><p>At Zamboanga, about 15:00 (local time), an earthquake recurred with the same force as the preceding one.\r\nThen a phenomenon occurred which caused great panic. The sea level fell 5 m, and then rose and fell with great speed. After several such oscillations in level, sea waves began to flood the city, although they did not advance further than the first few homes. The water picked up proas riding off shore and left them high and dry. According to eyewitnesses, the greatest oscillations in level were observed from 15:00 to 16:00, and at 16:00, the second of the strongest waves arrived. The phenomenon lasted a little less than 2 hours.\r\n</p><p>At Isabela, about half an hour after the earthquake, water burst with a roar into the northeastern passage leading to the port. The enormous waves moving from the west washed away everything on shore; the sea level rose at least 7 m above the usual mark. The sea rose and fell more than 30 times, and one of the waves was considerably larger than the others. The waves broke on shore with such force that they easily rolled building timber 6 m long and pieces of masonry. A grocery store was washed away, 25 homes were destroyed, and the gunboat General Laso was imperiled.\r\n</p><p>There were victims on the farms of the Moro tribe: at Panigayan, two injured: at Balauan, five dead, six injured; at Labotan, three dead, six injured; at Matiban, five dead, homes destroyed; eight homes were washed away at Tagu.\r\n</p><p>An eyewitness on a boat riding at anchor in Sibuguey Bay, related that the water raised the boat together with its two anchors several times and the ship was in great danger.\r\n</p><p>At Dapitan Port, the sea rose 2 m at the head of the bay.\r\n</p><p>At Negros Island, at noon a boat was crossing the bay; its movements were almost totally paralyzed by the waves.\r\n</p><p>On Jolo Island, 15 minutes after the earthquake, the sea began to rise and fall at 15 minute intervals, retreating 200-250 m from shore. The maximum height of rise of water was 1 m. The rough sea calmed by 21:30 (L.T.).\r\n</p><p>On Siau Island, Indonesia, the first drop in level was observed 1.5 hours after the earthquake. In 1/2 hour, the water retreated far beyond the ebb tide mark. Then it returned, reaching the flood tide mark in a few minutes. </p><p>Tsunami reports also came from the north coast of Calimantan island (Kudat region) and from the eastern shore of Sumatra Island.\r\n</p><p>Between Labuan Island and the coast of Calimantan Island, where the depth of the water had been 6 m, a new little island quietly rose out of the water after 13:00 on the 21st. The island was made up of clay and pebbles and was 200 m long, 150 m wide, and 20 m high. Its surface gave off hot gases and there was  a strong petroleum smell. It is possible that the island was built up by the tsunami waves; on the other hand, the island could have also been the result of an underwater mud eruption.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #1072:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>A tsunami claimed claimed hundreds of victims on the western shores of Basilan. \r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #1058:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>100 victims due to the tsunami.</p>",

A tsunami, which did not do great damage, was observed on the coast of Hokkaido Island and the Sanriku coast after the earthquake. The limited damage is partly explained by the fact that the tsunami coincided with the ebb tide phase. The protective works built after the Chilean tsunami of 1960 also played a large role. The waves had a height of 1-2 m on the south coast of Hokkaido Island, and 2-5 m in the regions of Tokachi and Hidaka. The tsunami also reached a height of 5 m in places on the Sanriku coast.\r\n</p><p>The tsunami was observed by tide gauges in Japan and throughout the Pacific Basin in Mexico, Russia, the Marshall Islands, Alaska, California, and Hawaii. \r\n</p><p>As a result of the earthquake and tsunami, 52 people died and 329 people were injured; 676 homes were completely destroyed and 2,994 homes were half destroyed; 13 homes burned down and 529 homes were flooded; 97 ships were washed away and 30 were sunk. In addition, roads, bridges and protective dikes were destroyed. The total damage was estimated at least at 130 million dollars. \r\n</p><p>The mean displacement of the surface of the sea at the source has been estimated by Abe at &#43;82 cm in the zone of elevations, and -20 cm in the the zone of subsidences. Aida estimated the maximal initial rise of water at 5 m, the drop at 2 m, and the energy of the tsunami at 4 X 10<sup>20</sup> ergs. The maximum radiation of the tsunami, according to his calculations, was directed along the minor axis of the source, while more long-period oscillations radiated out along the major axis. \r\n</p><p>View a calculated <a href=\"http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/seg/hazard/tsu_travel_time.shtml#Honshu1968\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">tsunami-travel-time map</a>.</p>",

There were 140 people\r\ninjured in Japan, including one woman whose car plunged off a collapsed bridge and one man who died of a heart attack. The earthquake generated a tsunami with a height of 4.5-6.0 m at the southern part of Dimitrova Bay, Shikotan Island and 3.0-7.1 meters at Tserkovnaya Bay indicating multiple\r\nwaves in the tsunami. Evidence of four separate runup heights also indicates a multiple wave attack.\r\n<p>On the west side of the island the height at Malo-kurilskaya was one to two meters. The tide gage\r\nindicated a subsidence of 53 cm. Eyewitnesses reported the initial wave to be a rise as was confirmed by the marigrams that also showed periods of about 20 minutes. Elsewhere on the island the heights were measured from <b>8.5 meters at Tserkovnaya Bay</b> to 2.6 meters. On Kunashiri Island\r\nthe maximum height was surveyed at 5.3 meters at Petrova Point.

All moorings were destroyed and two 300-ton fishing boats, five pontoons, and several motorboats were thrown on dry land. None of the fatalities were due to the tsunami as the maximum heights were 1.5-2.0 meters in populated areas.

Tonggolobibi is located only 14 kilometers from the epicenter that was a back arc event with deep thrusting. The <b>tsunami destroyed 183 houses</b> and damaged 228 units in the Bangkir-Tolitoli area. It affected about 100 kilometers of the coast but there were no reports of tsunami data being recorded outside of Sulawesi. The land subsided by about one meter. It occurred at high tide. As the wave arrival times were very short, (about five minutes after the earthquake) and several sites reported an initial withdrawal, some of the wave action may have been due to tsunami induced landslides. Breaking waves were also reported at about half of the sites. Three waves were observed. The wave penetrated as much as 200 meters up riverbeds and carried five boats including two 500-ton motorboats 250 meters on shore. Since the tsunami occurred at a high tide of 59 cm, and there was a subsidence of the land of about 70 cm, it was difficult to estimate the wave heights. (reference #1315)\r\n<p>In the Donggala regency, the most heavily damaged area\r\nwas Tongglolbibi village which belongs to the Dempelas\r\nSojol district. The tsunami attacked the village about 5\r\nminutes after the earthquake. The tsunami was reported to\r\n<b>runup 3-5m</b> and extend about 300m inland. A house\r\ndrifted 10m from its original foundation, and two 500-ton\r\nmotor boats drifted 250m ashore. In total, 9 people were\r\nkilled, 163 buildings (mostly wooden houses) were heavily\r\ndamaged, and 102 buildings were slightly damaged. The\r\nsevere effects of the tsunami at Tonggolobibi village were\r\nlikely due to its location on a concave coastline facing\r\ndirectly towards the epicentral area.\r\n</p><p>In the Buol Tolitoli regency, the most affected area was\r\nSoni village which belongs to the Dampal Selatan district.\r\nHowever, damage here is less than that at Tonggolobibi,\r\nand no loss of life occurred. The tsunami was reported to\r\nhave a runup at Soni of 1.5m and extend 200m inland. In\r\ntotal, 20 buildings (mostly wooden houses) were heavily\r\ndamaged, and 128 buildings were slightly damaged.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #2262)\r\n</p><p>Media report nearly 400 wooden houses and government buildings damaged and 8 people killed by the tidal wave.

As a result, 25 people were killed, 8 were missing, and 672 buildings were heavily damaged. The earthquake was of 6.5 surface magnitude (Mb), and was suspected of having a potential to generate local tsunami. The International Tsunami Information Center (ITIC) in Honolulu sent fax to BMG asking for confirmation about the tsunami, but no tsunami was confirmed. This is due to the fact that the earthquake is associated with a strike-slip mechanism of the South Sula - Sorong fault.&#34; (reference #2673)</p><p>Reference #4659 lists a tsunami having been generated.</p><p>Most of the deaths were on the westen part of Mangole, a timber producing island of 38,000 people near the quake&#39;s epicentre and 2,010 miles northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.

It was located only 50 km west of Port Vila and at the shallow depth of 21 km below the sea floor. Fifteen minutes after the main shock, a tsunami struck Port Vila Harbour. The event was followed that same night by a large aftershock (Mw 6.4) which also produced a tsunami, though much smaller in size. A tsunami of appreciable size was generated with the earthquake, but was fortunately small enough, given the extremely low tide at the time, not to cause any significant flooding above Highest Astronomical Tide (HAT) level. Had it struck at high tide, much flooding, damage and perhaps loss of life could have\r\nresulted. Although the tsunami only registered on the tide gauge as having a crest to trough amplitude of 0.8 m, eyewitness accounts in different parts of the harbour put the maximum effect at around 3.0 m, nearly four times that of the height recorded on the water level gauge.

Destruction of Minoan towns in North Crete coast (Amnisos, Nirou Khani, Malia, Pseira...) first hypotesised to be the effect of the tsunami by Marinatos [reference #2986]. Devastation from the tsunami occurred along northern Crete, western Cyprus, and the eastern Mediterranean as far as the Syrian coasts. Estimates of height of the tsunami vary from 40 to 90 m. The tsunami may have resulted from the caldera collapse, subsidence, or from an explosion when sea water encountered the hot magma in the collapsing caldera.

The reconstruction of events is based on the data of marine and ground geology,\r\ngeochemistry, archaeology, in combination with fragmentary allusions in annals and legends written considerably later.... </p><p>...Application of the methods of chemical analysis of isotopes has led to the conclusion that the first enormous eruption occurred earlier than 25,000 years ago, the second not earlier than 5,000 years ago. More accurately, the eruption has been dated at (1410 <u>&#43;</u> 100) B.C. using the Carbon - 14 isotope inside the fragment of an ancient tree found under the ash layer on the present day Island of Thira. An estimation of the age of this sample, performed later, by the same method resulted in the earlier date of the eruption and of the ashfall: between 1700 and 1620 B.C., most likely, in 1640 - 1620 B.C.\r\n</p><p>...More reliable evidence that the tsunami generated by the eruption of Santorini did reach the shores of the Near East, actually retaining its destructive force, was obtained during the geological exploration carried out in the region of the Syrian city of Ugarit, which used to be the capital of the ancient North - Phoenician state.

The town of Cos was almost completely destroyed, as was all but a small part of the island, and the death toll was heavy. Houses of unbaked brick or mud survived, but most houses, built of stone, were reduced to rubble and drinking water was also polluted by the sea wave. Agathias visited Cos, in the course of a voyage from Alexandria to Constantinople, shortly after the event, and was thus able to see the effects (although of course there may be some exaggeration). His chronology is so confused that the <b>date of the event is uncertain</b>. Agathias says \u0091 at around that time &#39; just after narrating the earthquake of July 551, but in ii. 15 and ii. 16 he regresses four years in his time sequence. Modern authors amalgamate this earthquake with the event of AD 551 that destroyed the Phoenician coast, 800 km away from Cos (McCail 1967, 243). Agathias also visited the island in AD 558, on his return from Constantinople, but Guidoboni et al. (1994, 338-339) note that this visit was before the Constantinople earthquake of AD 557 and date the event between AD 554 and 558 on the assumption that Egypt was affected by an earthquake in AD 554 (Guidoboni 1989, 703).

Constantinople (Istanbul), intensity 3.\r\nIn Pinar&#39;s earthquake catalogue, we find an earthquake\r\nwhich occurred in Constantinople on April 1646. As a result of the shock 136 ships, we are informed, were thrown on land. This event we also find in Huot (1837) who adds that the earthquake shock itself was not severe. Nevertheless, the sea rushed inland so violently that 136 sailing ships were cast on shore. The original source of information seems to be a letter of Dr. Vivoli, to which unfortunately have not had access. It is quite clear that what Huot describes is the result of a seismic sea-wave which it is of interest to notice that in this case was caused by a rather mild shock.\r\n</p><p>From Mallet (1858) we learn that on April 5, 1646, an earthquake occurred also in Italy. Magri (1647) says that this earthquake caused much damage in Livorno where sea-waves damaged the ships at anchor in the harbour of the town. Mallet regards these two earthquakes to have occurred simultaneously on the 5th of April 1646. On the basis of the available information on these two events it is difficult to appreciate this coincidence. If Mallet&#39;s view was correct, it is difficult to distinguish whether the event of April in Constantinople was the result of a strong sea-wave which was set up by the Livorno earthquake or of a local seismic sea-wave.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #27)</p>",

At Kinsale, at about 6 p.m., the sea rose suddenly 2 ft. and retreated rapidly in 4 min., this being repeated, though to a less estent, several times. At Carrick, at 4 p.m., the surface of the river Suir rose 1 ft. in five minutes. At Dungarvan, the sea ebbed and flowed five times between 4 and 9 p.m. At Waterford, the sea advanced 30 ft. along the shore, while at Ross (Co.

At Terceira, in the Azores, the sea rose to a great height and then fell so low that the quays were left dry. At Barbadoes, at about 8.5 hours after the earthquake, the sea, then near low water, suddenly retired from the shore and in about 3 min. returned, rising to the height of nearly 4 ft.

Before the catastrophe, there were 120 homes on this island in the villages and temporary settlements, and about 1000 people lived there. Ninety-six homes were destroyed by the earthquake and tsunami; about 3/4 of the population perished.

Extracted from a Letter to Capt. Nelson, R. E.\r\n<p>[Communicated by the President.]\r\n</p><p>&#34;One of Capt. McMurdo&#39;s guides was travelling on foot to him from Bhooj. The day he reached Luckput there were shocks of an earthquake, which shook down part of the walls of the fort, and some lives were lost. At the same time as the shock the sea rolled up the Koree (the eastern) mouth of the Indus, overflowing the country as far westward as the Goongra river (a distance of twenty English miles), northward as far as a little north of Veyre (forty miles from the mouth of the Koree), and eastward to the Sindree\r\nLake. The guide was detained six days (from June 19th to 25th), during which time sixty-six shocks were counted. He then got across to Kotree, of which only a few small buildings on a bit of rising ground remained. Most of the habitations throughout the district must have been swept away, the best houses in Scinde being built of sun-dried bricks, and whole villages consisting only of huts made of a few crooked poles and reed mats. The guide traveled\r\ntwenty miles through water on a camel, the water up to the beast&#39;s body. Of Lak nothing was above water but a Fakeer&#39;s pole (the flagstaff always erected by the tomb of some holy man); and of Veyre and other villages only the remains of a few houses were to be seen.\r\n</p><p>&#34; There are said to be generally two earthquakes every year at Luckput.

The natives told me that during my absence they had experienced on the coast and the mountains several earthquakes, on which occasions some natives were killed by the falling of cocoanut trees in the villages, which in falling destroyed the huts. The villages on the coast suffered more on account of unusually big waves which followed soon after the earthquake, breaking down the cocoanut trees and sweeping away a few huts nearest to the beach. In revisiting the coast villages, I found many not unimportant changes: stretches of destroyed forest by tidal waves after the earthquake; alteration in the direction of some small streams, the old mouths of which had been closed by bars of sand left behind by waves.

The earthquake at Circular Head. Sir, - Since my last communication, published in your paper on the 10th inst., relative to the shock of an earthquake in this district, on the 29th October, we have had four more, - one on Sunday last, the 20th, at half past three in the afternoon accompanied by a rumbling noise, with a distinct movement of the ground. The day was clear and warm; the barometre 30 inches. Again on Monday night or strictly speaking Tuesday morning, the 22nd instant, another slight shock was felt; at half past three p.m. a second, and at ten minutes before five in the morning a third. The latter shock was by far the severest ever known in the colony; the whole earth moved like a huge wave, startling the people from one end of the district to the other.  The only damage done, yet ascertained, is the destruction of a brick oven on my farm; the fall of a portion of a stone chimney, a part breaking the roof of a stable; the cracking of a chimney on Anderson&#39;s farm, at Black River; and a considerable in just to Mr Ford&#39;s house at Highfields; and it was observed that the Prince of Wales schooner, lying at anchor at Duck Bay, had the bow rope taut and the stern fastening slack, immediately before the shock, whilst the reverse was the case directly afterwards, showing that the vessel had been moved several feet.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #7675)\r\n</p><p>The Hobart Town Daily Mercury, 23 November 1859. Earthquake at Circular Head. This morning at ten minutes to five o&#39;clock, a violent shock of an earthquake was felt here, frightening the inhabitants out of their beds, and even out of their houses, many expecting them to fall. The shock as so great that women were running about in their night dresses not knowing what was the matter. The shock was preceded by a low rumbling noise which lasted a minute; it was then followed by a tremendous shaking, upsetting bottles and crockery and creating a great clatter... The course of the shock was from north to south as nearly as I could judge. This is the second severe shock that has been felt here within the last month. There was a severe shock felt here on Sunday at 3 p.m., and there were at least two previous shocks during the last night but not so severe as the one I have above mentioned. (ref. #7735)</p>",

The epicenter, as reported by the US Geological Survey (USGS), was located approximately 75 km due south of the El Salvador coastline (Fig. 1). Approximately 50 aftershocks with magnitudes between 5.5 and 4.2 occurred in the vicinity of the main event between 27 August and 11 September 2012. The initial assessment of the earthquake by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) determined that the earthquake was significant due to the strength of the seismic signal and the long-period nature of the initial seismic waves. Within 10 min of the main shock, additional analysis by the PTWC suggested that the earthquake could be characterized as a \u0091slow&#39; earthquake.\r\n</p><p>The strongest tsunami effects were experienced along the central section of the San Juan del Gozo Peninsula. At the time of the earthquake (*10:37 p.m.) it was relatively dark with a quarter moon low over the horizon and a moonset near 1 a.m. The earthquake occurred just after high tide when scores of people were present on the beach collecting sea turtle eggs for conservation projects. A worker at one of the hatcheries was in a ramada (a small shed with wooden posts, and walls and roof made from aluminum siding) located on the beach at the crest of the dunes approximately 70 m from the water when the earthquake occurred. This witness came out of the ramada when he heard people crying out and was subsequently caught in the wave and dragged some 90 m inland where he was ultimately suspended in a tree branch at a height of 2.1 m above the ground. This witness reported that there were three tsunami waves and that the flow depth at the ramada was just below the roof (approx. 2.5 m). During the tsunami, the walls of the ramada were torn off of the posts that are deeply embedded in the sand; the posts themselves were not pulled out of the ground, but some were pushed over by the force of the water. Other witnesses related similar stories, and in total there were more than 40 injured people, with three injuries requiring medical attention.</p>",

According to initial water-level measurements by Stuart Weinstein of the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) (via the International Tsunami Bulletin Board), the tsunami was recorded on several tide gauges in southern Mexico and El Salvador. Based on this information, the largest tsunami amplitudes occurred during the first five hours of the observed arrival times at each tide gauge except for the El Salvador location, where the peak occurred 14 hours after first arrival. Videos posted on Youtube indicate that there was minor flooding along the waterfront of the harbor at Puerto Chiapas. In the far field, the maximum tsunami amplitudes from this event were all less than 0.35m, which was the measured amplitude in Owenga, Chatham Islands, in New Zealand (PTWC). (reference #11912)\r\n<p>The associated tsunami waves were recorded first at Huatulco tide gauge station at 5:04 (GMT) 12 min after the earthquake. We covered ground observations along 41 km of the coast of Chiapas, encompassing the sites with the highest projected wave heights based on our preliminary tsunami model (maximum tsunami amplitudes between 94.5 and 93.0W). Runup and inundation distances were measured along eight sites. The tsunami occurred at low tide. The maximum runup was ~3 m at Boca del Cielo, and maximum inundation distance was 190 m in Puerto Arista, corresponding to the coast in front of the epicenter and in the central sector of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Tsunami scour and erosion was evident along the Chiapas coast. Tsunami deposits, mainly sand, reached up to 32 cm thickness thinning landward up to 172 m distance. (reference #11983)</p>",

Arctic Command published pictures of the mountain at Karrat Ice Fjord, where there has been a huge shift. An area of about 300 times 1100 meters crashed into the sea. According Arctic Command it is probably the cause of the tsunami on Saturday night.

However, in the aftermath of the event, scientists have examined the event more carefully, and have now determined that there was no earthquake. Instead, the landslide was so large that it generated significant seismic energy. Two clues that led scientists to see that there had in fact been no earthquake were the duration and characteristic of the seismic signals. Not only did the seismic waves last for approximately five minutes, but they were monochromatic and slowly increased in amplitude (the highest amplitude waves lasted about 30 seconds). Such traits, according to the IRIS blog, authored by John Clinton (ETH Zurich), Tine Larsen, Trine Dahl-Jensen, Peter Voss (GEUS Copenhagen), and Meredith Nettles (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University) are &#34;indicative of complex landslide signals.&#34; (ref #11836)\r\n</p><p>The team, including the acclaimed environmental scientist Hermann Fritz, has estimated that the wave at the coast where the landslide struck reached a marked 90 meters altitude.

The length of the Tafjord is about 9 km from the innermost village Tafjord to the village Fjora. The depth is about 200-220 m and the average width a little more than 1 km. There is no sill in the bend between Fjora and Sylte. Depth contour lines are depicted in Fig.2. The position of the slide area is shown in Fig.1. The upper part of the slide was released from about 730 m above the fjord. Before the slide, the main rock reposed on a fault plane with an inclination varying from 35\u00b0 on top to 45\u00b0 by the fjord. The rock slide consisting of gneiss, constituted a volume of 1,000,000- 1,500,000 m^3 with an estimated mass of 4,000.000-5,000,000 tons. Beneath the rock a moraine scree named Heggura, of at least the same volume, was released. According to the eye witnesses the Tafjord village was hit by three separated huge waves, at 3- to 5-min intervals. (reference #3840)</p>"

The powerful storm caused extensive wind damage, hail, and also produced nine tornadoes in Connecticut, New York, and Pennsylvania. As the storm tracked southeast across southern Connecticut and Long Island (~2100-2300 UTC May 15th), 3 to 5.5mb pressure rises in 5 to 20 minutes were observed. Weather-induced wave activity was observed locally on the tide gauges in Long Island Sound. The storm also generated a small meteotsunami off the Long Island/New Jersey coastline which was measured (4cm) on the deep ocean DART buoy at 2330 UTC May 15. The storm front then moved south across Maryland and Southern New Jersey (2300UTC May 15 to 0400 UTC May 16), slowing as it did so. Pressure rises were on the order of 1-2mb in 20-40 minutes. Weather-induced wave activity was observed locally on the tide gauges in Chesapeake Bay as persistent southwesterly winds (up the bay) ahead of the storm front abruptly shifted to northerly.

Large lobster cars flipped over or started to drift out to sea... At around noon Tuesday, fishermen in Corea noticed unusual weather conditions: Tides seemed abnormally high, winds pounded the area, and daylight seemed to dim, then brighten again. They had just experienced what Raymond Dunbar Jr. defined as a &#34;bore tide&#34; -- a 5- to 6-foot-high wall of water. Dunbar, who was watching the storm... said he saw the tide&#39;s effect on Bruce Crowley&#39;s boat. &#34;It had horsed up around another one,&#34; he said. He saw the boat disappear. &#34;By that time the tide had bore out again, and she (Crowley&#39;s boat) went down out of sight and it made me think more that she had parted her mooring.&#34; Dwight Rodgers, manager of the Corea Co-op, said Wednesday that the tidal action was spectacular. &#34;There was a lot of water in the harbor and, as if somebody opened a drain, the water just disappeared,&#34; he said. The tidal bore created a whirlpool effect that caused some of the nearly 30 boats moored in the harbor to whip around each other. Harvey Crowley... could not believe what he saw. &#34;Boats were all snarled up, lobster cars were out in the middle of the harbor upside down,&#34; he said...  The tidal action caused one lobster car filled with lobsters to drag its two moorings. A 22-by-14-foot lobster car belonging to Dunbar&#39;s son flipped over...  Lobsterman Bruce Crowley said he noticed a difference in the tide as he watched it from his home near Corea Harbor. &#34;I saw the water all go out, just for a minute. It was up one minute and it was gone the next. It went fast,&#34; he said. Dunbar said he watched as Bruce Crowley&#39;s lobster car broke loose, headed out to sea, and then was pushed back into the harbor by a large wave. &#34;When that lobster car came in the second time, you couldn&#39;t row a dinghy fast enough to keep up with it. That was how fast it came up with the tide. ... It was scary,&#34; he said. Babe Crowley, whose home overlooks the harbor, said the tidal surge was unlike anything he had seen in his 63 years. He estimated that the wind gusted to about 80 miles per hour... (reference #9221)\r\n<p>Geologist explains tidal phenomenon at Corea Harbor, Bangor Daily News, January 7, 1994. Joe Kelley, director of marine geology for the Maine Geological Survey, who is based at the University of Maine, said... &#34;What was described in that article certainly was unusual for any area. To have water leave a harbor suddenly and then come back in suddenly as a large wave is not usual. It takes a lot of force to move water, and while there was a storm going on, that probably wasn&#39;t all of it,&#34;... Kelley said he had ruled out several causes. He said the event was not a tidal bore because the tides were not right. He also ruled out the possibility that the event was a tsunami... Tsunamis are related to earthquakes and a call to the Weston Geophysical Observatory in Weston, Mass., Kelley said, revealed there had been no earthquake in the North Atlantic area. The U.S. Weather Service, Kelley said, had reported that just before noon, the atmospheric pressure in Providence, R.I. dropped severely... The geologist said he believed the disturbance at Corea Harbor may have been caused by methane gas escaping from the ocean&#39;s mud bottom. He said that several years ago he had explored several methane-related holes in the sea floor in Belfast Bay [Maine]... &#34;What I think happened is a sudden change in the pressure raises the water level that loads the ocean floor, squeezes a bubble of (methane) gas which pushes water out and causes a wave to come into the harbor. The bubble breaks, and the water rushes back out to fill the void,&#34; he said. Kelly said the event apparently repeated itself several times. (reference #9220)</p>"

It was the strongest explosion in historical times in Indonesia. It was accompanied by considerable oscillations in sea level. The eruption began on April 1. At 22:00 [local time] at Bajuwangi (Java Island), a cannonade boomed out like peals of distant thunder. It was repeated from time to time, and this continued until 9:00 on the 2nd. On the morning of the 3rd, a light fall of ashes began; on the 5th, explosions began to be heard at 1/4 hour intervals.\r\n</p><p>The eruption reached its peak on the evening of the 10th, when a colossal pillar of smoke rose above the volcano and the entire mountain seemed to eject flame. Soon the volcano and all that occurred there were hidden in a dense cloud of smoke. \r\n</p><p>The sound of a shot was so loud that it was heard for an enormous distance: from Bengkulu and Banka Island in the west to Ternate Island in the east. At Surabaja, the air wave uprooted trees, destroyed the walls of homes, and bowled over people and animals. The tremors were felt more or less strongly at Banjuwangi, Sumenep, Surakarta, Rembang, apparently on the southeast of Kalimantan Island, at Makassar and on Flores Island.\r\n</p><p><b>Scorching hot slag and ashes covered all of Sumbawa Island and a sizeable water area.

On Java Island, the ashfall was so dense that complete darkness set in. The ashes fell on Java at a distance of 550 km from the volcano; it also fell on Sulawesi Island at Ambon. From this one can conclude that the ash was ejected to a very great height, as otherwise it would have been carried by the trade winds only to the west.\r\n</p><p>On the 10th, with still weather, the sea off the coast of Sumbawa Island suddenly rose to a height of 0.5 to 3.5 m. Large waves burst into the estuaries of the rivers and immediately surged back. Here and there homes and trees were washed away. At Bima, the water submerged the floors of homes by 0.3 m. All the proas and boats were torn from their anchors and tossed onshore. The coast at the Tambora volcano subsided so that water 5-6 m deep appeared in place of the land.\r\n</p><p>Short-period (duration no more than 3 minutes) oscillations in level were noted on Sulawesi and Java Islands. At Sumenep, on the 11th at 19:00 during an ebb tide, a flood tide of water from the bay made the river rise 1-1.5 m; then the level fell for 4 minutes.\r\n</p><p>The explosions of the volcano, which were accompanied by strong tremors, lasted several more days.

Many of the fatalities occurred when tsunami capsized boats filled with fleeing residents. Newspaper and other reports suggesting 3,000-5,000 deaths are very unreliable. (reference #9675)\r\n<p>A moderately violent phreatomagmatic explosive eruption of Taal Volcano, in the Philippines, occurred from 28 to 30 September 1965. The main phreatic explosions, which were preceded by ejection of basaltic spatter, opened a new crater 1.5 kilometers long and 0.3 kilometer wide on the southwest side of Volcano Island in Lake Taal. The eruption covered an area of about 60 square kilometers with a blanket of ash more than 25 centimeters thick and killed approximately 190 persons. ..\r\n</p><p>The explosions within the crater area produced shock waves that generated water waves, which probably reached\r\nmaximum height between Volcano Island and the west shore of Lake Taal. These waves capsized some of the boats filled with the fleeing residents of the island and accounted for many of the fatalities. The maximum height of the waves is not known, because evidence of wave height during the early, most violent phase of the eruption is now covered by layers of ash. However, on the west shore of Lake Taal, directly west of the mouth of the explosion crater, there is clear evidence that waves reached 4.7 meters above lake\r\nlevel and swept inshore as much as 80 meters. The debris left by these waves is on top of the air-fall ash, hence the waves must have occurred very late in the eruption. Undoubtedly much larger waves swept that coast earlier. \r\n</p><p>A streamflow gage 1.5 kilometers downstream from the outlet of Lake Taal shows an increase of flow from an average of 20,500 liters per second for several days before the eruption to a maximum of 28,400 liters per second on 28 September, followed by decreases to 23,800 liters per second\r\non 29 September, and 22,800 liters per second on 30 September. Such an increase is probably due to excessive\r\nwave action and to seiches produced by the explosion shock waves, as well as to displacement of water by the ash fall and to the inordinately heavy rain that accompanied the eruption.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #5094)\r\n</p><p>Many of the 190-355 fatalities occurred when tsunami waves capsized boats containing residents fleeing from Taal Island to the western shore of the lake (near Agoncillo). The waves inundated areas up to 4.7 m above the level of the lake (Moore et al. 1966). (reference #12533)</p>",

The explosions were subaerial and the volume of products emitted by each explosion was small, and we did not observe other tsunamis during the day when the severity of eruptions increased. We suppose,therefore, that the tsunami could be related to a small landslide of the flank of Anak. (reference #12821)",

There was a multiple eruption of the Miyejin submarine volcano (31 deg 56.7 min N., 140 deg 0.5 min E.) 130 km south of Hachijo Island. The augite-hypersthene-dacite composition of the lavas determined the explosive nature of the eruptions. All the explosions were well recorded by the hydrophones of the American SOFAR system, including those on the coast of California. Some of the eruptions were observed visually from ships and airplanes by Japanese specialists. Thus, during the weak eruption of September 23 at 13h 40m, a water dome, with protuberances 600-800 m high and 2 km in diameter, arose over the volcano. No seaquake was felt , but waves 50 m long and 2 m high spread over the sea surface. During the stronger eruptions weak tsunamis were generated, 52 of which were registered by the tide gauge on Hachijo Island. The strongest of these waves were also registered by tide gauges on Jogashima Island and Cape Omae on the south coast of Japan. The travel time of the waves to Hachijo Island was about 30 minutes, the period 1.5 minutes, the height 10-90 cm. In the nature of dispersion and other parameters, the waves corresponded to theoretical Cauchy-Poisson waves from an initial impulse with a source diameter of 2 &#43; km. Some waves were like pulses. This was apparently due to the interference of waves bending around both sides of Aoga-shima Island, midway between the volcano and Hachijo Island.</p><p>The tsunami of September 26 was recorded in Hilo, in the Hawailan Islands with an amplitude of less than 0.1 m.</p><p>The ship &#34;Kiyo Maru No 5&#34; of the Japanese hydrographic service, which had come out to study the eruption, was lost in the eruption of September 24.</p></blockquote>",

Huge streams of lava up to one cubic km in volume emerged, one of which moved in a northeasterly direction and reached the ocean shore, a distance 12 km from the crater on December 6, 1905. Fields and villages situated in the path of the lava stream were destroyed. From time to time the lava tongues fell into the water and gave rise to small tsunami-type waves (including at the end of 1906 and in 1907). One of the phases of the eruption was observed by the missionary, John Farlong. According to his account, after some periods marked by earth tremors, on August 4, 1908, two yawning fissures appeared from which clouds of steam, illuminated by flames and eruptive material, shot up with explosive force. The streams of lava moved at a rate of 900 m (1/2 mile) in a 24 hour period, and at the points where the lava fell into the sea huge columns of steam rose, several times in the same area. They were 450 m (500 yards) in length and inundated the land for a distance of 90-110 m (100-120 yards). According to observers, the appearance of the waves coincided with increasing volcanic activity. (reference #415)\r\n<p>1905-1911. The Matavanu volcano eruption first began on August 4 of 1905.

After this incident, upon\r\nreaching the harbor, the team reported that the boat was\r\nstaying lower on the quay than normal. Some time later,the workers noted that the boat was then staying half a\r\nmetre higher than its former position and deduced that\r\nthe lake level was greatly fluctuating without generating\r\nany noticeable surface waves. The time period between\r\nthe highest and lowest lake level (with approximately\r\nhalf metre amplitude) was 15-20 min (pers. comm.

        "comments": "1905-1911. The volcano Matavanu on the island of Savaii (Samoan Islands) was active between August 4, 1905, and November. Huge streams of lava up to one cubic km in volume emerged, one of which moved in a northeasterly direction and reached the ocean shore, a distance 12 km from the crater on December 6, 1905. Fields and villages situated in the path of the lava stream were destroyed. From time to time the lava tongues fell into the water and gave rise to small tsunami-type waves (including at the end of 1906 and in 1907). One of the phases of the eruption was observed by the missionary, John Farlong. According to his account, after some periods marked by earth tremors, on August 4, 1908, two yawning fissures appeared from which clouds of steam, illuminated by flames and eruptive material, shot up with explosive force. The streams of lava moved at a rate of 900 m (1/2 mile) in a 24 hour period, and at the points where the lava fell into the sea huge columns of steam rose, several times in the same area. They were 450 m (500 yards) in length and inundated the land for a distance of 90-110 m (100-120 yards). According to observers, the appearance of the waves coincided with increasing volcanic activity. (reference #415)\r\n<p>1907, October 6. According to Anderson (1910, reference #4097), the largest and most important tsunami that was caused by the Matavanu volcano eruption occurred on October 6, 1907 at about 5:30 p.m. local time. The largest and most important of the series was that on Sunday, October 6th, 1907, at about 5:30 p.m. It was just at the time of high water, but the sea was smooth. The wave was 10 or 12 feet high; it came from the north-east round the lave-point, as in fact the others had done, and at the Deutsche Handels &amp; Plantagen Gesellschaft&#39;s place a boat-house was wrecked, a buggy in it smashed, and several boats were damaged; while, at a house a few score yards off, a 400-gallon tank of water was lifted bodily from its foundation and carried across the road. The wave appears to have spent itself here and, it was thought, probably rebounded out to sea. No damage was done at the Government Offices, 150 yards distant, nor in either direction along the coast. The wave was noticed, but of smaller size, in some of the other islands. At Apia it had a height of only 1or 2 feet. It was probably connected with the lava falling into the sea , but the exact cause was uncertain. Possibly it was due to a steam explosion.

Fifty four of the 56 people in the village were killed in the landslide, which flowed into the lake carrying trees with it. \r\nThe site was devastated again and many killed by a landslide from the same source in 1910 March 20 (q.v.). On that occasion, a tsunami occurred in the lake, the surges being large enough to cause problems for some children in the water on the opposite shore (Motutere?). \r\nWhile no waves or surges are mentioned in the account of the 1846 event, a taniwa [taniwha] is, i.e. &#34;The natives say that afterwards the Taniwa fled across the lake to Motutere and thence to Waikato, whence he will go to the sea and perish there; they shall be no more troubled with him; they saw the splash of his tail as lie crossed the lake&#34; (New Zealand Spectator &amp; Cook&#39;s Strait Guardian 1 July 1846).  According to King et al. (2007), events involving large waves, storm surges and tsunamis were commonly explained as the work of taniwha in Maori traditional stories. In light of this, it is likely that the taniwha in the lake after the landslide in 1846 represents a tsunami. \r\nThe occurrence of a tsunami is given a validity of 3 (probable).\r\nInterestingly, the account indicates another landslide 10 years before 1846, before organised European settlement.

So, if the tsunamis in 1877 and 1882 at Binh Thuan coast really happened, the earthquakes that caused the tsunamis could have been caused by submarine volcanoes. Since at the time there was no seismic recording station near the Vietnam coast, the earthquakes were not recorded.

There was no information on volcanic activities related to this earthquake. However, it is written in a historical book &#34;Dai Nam nhat thong chi&#34; (Volume 12) as follows: &#34;in Binh Thuan, there is a swarm of volcanoes in the northern part of Tuy Phong ward, next to Hoa Da ward in the north. The swarm consists of about ten volcanoes standing next to each other.

According to a report from Cuale (Mexico, Jalisco State), the sea left its usual bed on a very long stretch of Coast on March 12. It retreated far from shore, so that elevations and depressions on its bottom dried up. In particular, one could see that the Las Tres Marias Islands are the tops of a large underwater mountain protruding over the water surface. Many different fishes, as well as corals, shell fish and other benthic animals were stranded on the irregularities of the sea floor. It is not known how long the ebb tide lasted, but some time later, the sea returned rather quickly and with considerable noise to its previous position. Nothing about an earthquake was reported. On the following day, a hurricane and downpour broke on this locality. (reference #415)"

The tsunami wave started with a large drop in water level; ships were left high &amp; dry; many sea animals were beached; citizens rushed to the exposed shore to pick up fish with their hands. About 15min later a large wave appeared with a roar, sweeping everything in its path. This turned out to be unexpected for the many thousand people crowding the coast and resulted in their death. Broken ships were found 2km from the coastal line on the southwestern shore of Pelponnesus near Methone. Achaea &amp; other districts (Boeotia, Epirus) in the north of Pelponnesus were damaged. About <strong>5000 people were killed in Greece</strong>.<br />In the northern part of the Adriatic Sea, rivers flowed backwards; the sea retreated from the coastal line.

In the region of the lagoon of al-Manzala, east of the Delta between Damietta and Port Said, the land previously rich became a desert:...the sea rose suddenly due to the earthquake, rushing over its limits, ruining all villages, covering with salt the land which before was fertile...only villages on high ground survived. Later writers add that in Alexandria alone <strong>50000 houses were flooded and 5000 people were drowned</strong>; ships were carried by the waves over the city walls and boats in the Nile were deposited on dry land about 3.5km from river. The region of Tinnis and the town itself were totally destroyed. The sea-wave had equally destructive effects in other parts of the eastern Mediterranean region...more likely that the damaging effects of the earthquake were confined between Messenia and Laconia in the Peloponnese, the west part of Crete and Cyrenaiea, but not further west.(ref #3845)</p><p>365 July 21. 35N 23E, magnitude 8, intensity X, tsunami intensity VI.

Several towers in Lucerne were destroyed, and Renward Cysat, the registrar of Lucerne at that time, reported in his chronicle, &#34;What scared people most was that the out flowing river Reuss flowed back into Lake Lucerne so that the riverbed between the two parts of the city almost became dry and several people\r\ncould cross it by foot, before the water again vehemently advanced towards the city&#34; (Cysat, 1601, p. 884). As Cysat traveled along the lake&#39;s shore, he recorded observations such as: &#34;Ships had been thrown onshore ... up to two halberds [~4 m] aboye the lake level. ... Small islands and shoals had disappeared,&#34; (p. 883) as did &#34;entire houses with sleeping people&#34; (Cysat, 1601, p. 887). In Lucerne, the cyclic oscillation of lake level (seiche) had a period of 10 min and an estimated amplitude of 1-2 m (Cysat, 1601; Siegenthaler et al., 1987). An earthquake of this magnitude could not have directly caused such massive water movements that lasted several hours. In fact, Siegenthaler et al.

There was an earthquake (17 S 72 W, mag 8.5) and tsunami in Peru and in the northern part of Chile. The tsunami flooded the coastline for a distance of 1200 km. Arica suffered most of all. According to a report of the governor of Arica, the ocean receded a distance of two musket shots further than its normal low water point, and then, while the tremors were still occurring, raged with such force that it covered the islet of Alacran, situated opposite the high part of the city. A barrack-type building (wooden or adobe) was carried away with this first wave. The second shock, which occurred 15 minutes after the first ebb, caused the water to recede again, only to reappear in rising form, sweeping the town and carrying away warehouses, stores, and a large church, and advancing another 100 m inland and destroying all houses. Subsequently, the water receded to the point where the anchors of all ships were exposed... Three persons drowned in Arica itself, and more than twenty along the coast... In Ilo, the water rose to a point where it advanced almost 2 km inland along a valley uprooting 100-year old fig trees. Eleven indians were drowned... Three high tides and ebbs were reported to have occurred in Camana. The water advanced along a valley for more than 2 km destroying everything in its path.

The exact date is given in an inventory of military supplies salvaged\r\nfrom the tsunami, dated December 5, 1604 and signed by the\r\nCorregidor of Arica. The port of Arica, formerly located near the center of the bay, was completely destroyed by the tsunami and the town was rebuilt at its present location, close to the famous Rock or &#34;Morro&#34; of Arica. Arequipa, in the Peruvian interior at a distance of about 260 km, was almost completely destroyed; only the convent of San Francisco remained standing. People were thrown to the ground by the earthquake; the losses were estimated at more than a million gold pesos. The tsunami is not accurately described, but it is known that at least three successive waves flooded the coast line along an extension of 300 &#34;leguas&#34;, or 1200 km. The Peruvian port of Pisco more than 800 km northwest of Arica, was damaged by the tsunami according to one report. Damage from the tsunami extended across the Pacific Ocean. The effects of this great earthquake, as far as they are known, were similar to those of the great Arica earthquake of August 13, 1868. The\r\nmagnitude is estimated at 8 1/4-8 1/2.

For the first time in its history, the port of Valparaiso was flooded and considerably damaged. In the lower area of Almendral, all houses, fortifications and warehouses were destroyed by the flood. In Concepcion, the sea receded a great distance, only to &#34;swell&#34; and advance so quickly that it swept everything in its path, inundating the fields and town. Only two or three persons perished, since the inhabitants, on first noting the receding sea, ran for the hills from where they watched the destruction of their houses and their property.

Five very strong earthquakes occurred in a short interval of time (February-March), causing destructions and a lot of victims in a vast region embracing the whole southern Calabria and the Messina area, Sicily.  The 5 February [12hr] earthquake abruptly opened the seismic period. More than 380 villages damaged, 180 almost totally ruined. More than 25,000 victims, mostly because of the violent fire following the shock. \r\n<p>Coast from Messina to Torre del Faro (about 11 miles) and from Cenidio to Scilla (about 7 miles) heavily affected by the tsunami. Sea generally reported to recede and then to inundate the shore. Withdrawals and inundations repeated at least three times at intervals of about 10-15 min. At Joppolo a cosiderable sea withdrawal was observed leaving sea bottom dried. In the sea between Nicotera and Gioa Tauro, two waves seen to form by two fishermen: one travelled toward Capo Vaticano and the other toward Gioia del Tirreno. This was as high as a big vessel, but caused no damage. Probably the same fact reported occurring about 8 minutes after the shock. At Nicotera where two big waves were observed to form offshore: one heading toward the coast, the other travelling seaward. At Nicotera the sea withdrew boiling and then turned the fishing-boats upside-down. At Gioa del Tirreno the sea inundated the shore without any damage. At Scilla the sea withdrew for more than 10 meters leaving the sea bottom dry and a lot of fish on the beach; then suddenly the water came back surpassing its usual limit of about 1,5 meters and flooding the coast. Oscillation repeated with period of 15 minutes. \r\nAt Messina the sea overpassed the quays, destroying them, and violently inundated the theathre Marittimo. Sea agitated for three days after the main shock. At Torre del Faro, sea retreat followed by inundation observed. The water of the two marshes, Pantano Piccolo and Pantano Grande, receded). The sea coming back, partly destroyed the lighthouse and penetreted as far as the two marshes, inundating wineyards, then withdrew dragging many boats livestock and leaving fish on shore. The sea receding dragged some fishermen. At Catona the sea flooded the coast for a short stretch. At Reggio Calabria the sea surpassed the beach arriving at the coastal road inundating some twon district. At San Gregorio a rockfall fell into the sea generating sea waves. In the stretch of coast from Bianco to Roccella Ionica (about 35 km long) the beach was flooded by about one mile. At Roccella the wave was observed about 7 minutes after the shock. The sea reached the monastery of the Minims Paolotti carrying many boats onland.\r\n</p><p>Simulated numerically by Tinti (ref #1407).\r\n<br />Revisions: Graziani (ref #3954), Tinti (ref #2761).</p>",

This magnitude 7.9 earthquake was moderately strong at Yakutat but extremely violent at Cape Yakataga, 160 km to the west, where faulting probably occurred.  The shock broke off the tops of trees, generated landslides, and raised the ocean beach about 1 meter. No loss of life or property occurred in the region.  The shock was felt at about 30 known locations and as far away as the Yukon River, 1,100 km from Yakutat Bay. Strong aftershocks were observed on September 4, 1899.\r\n<p>The earthquake occurred at the half ebb. The sea receded from shore, and its level fell to full ebb tide in 20 minutes. The schooner &#34;Bellingham&#34; was situated 2 km (a mile) from Cape Yakataga. A strong seaquake was felt on board, and lasted about 2 minutes. On a stretch of coast at least 200 km (110 miles) long, from Icy Bay to Kayak Island, clouds of dust could be seen rising in the air from numerous avalanches, slides, and collapses; this process spread from one end of the coast to the other in about 5 minutes. An ebb tide, with a speed of about 3-4 knots, began from shore; a ship was dragged and the anchor chain stretched. After a rather long interval, the ebb tide was succeeded by a slow flood tide, which reached half the height indicated in the flood tide tables. During the day on the 4th, a ship approached Kayak Island with great difficulties. Small flood tide waves in Lynn Canal 1/4-1/2 m (1-2 feet) high were reported [these were obviously seiches, not a tsunami] (Reference #415).</p>",

February 15.--The first shock of the earthquake which caused so much damage and loss of life in the province of Esmeraldas was felt at 10 o&#39;clock on Jan. 31st, the disturbance continuing at short intervals until Feb. 6th. The inhabitants, panic-stricken, abandoned their homes and families and are still living in the open air, fearing a repetition of the shocks. In the neighborhood of Port Limon four small islands disappeared. These islands were inhabited by fishermen, who escaped in small boats, which they were at sea for three days, until the water became sufficiently calm to enable them to reach the mainland. The city of Esmeraldas was nearly inundated by a tidal wave which entered the port, flooding the principal streets. All the inhabitants ran for the mountains in the neighborhood. All the towns in the provinces of Esmeraldas and Manabi were greatly damaged. Most of the inhabitants are homeless. At the Colombian towns of Mosquera, San Juan and Domingoritz more than 300 persons perished. (reference #8876)\r\n</p><p>1906. High waves invaded Los Negritos Beach.

A catastrophic earthquake (intensity&#61;XI), preceded by a strong shock of an hour earlier, took place on the Isthmus of Corinth. The sea level rose suddenly in the port of Karistos in the south of the island of Euboea: the rise of the sea level reached 30 cm for 10 min. Then the water rolled away from the coast at a velocity of 3-4 knots and became 10 cm lower. This phenomenon was repeated several times over 22 hours, reaching its greatest intensity at 11h, when one boat could not leave the port in spite of all the efforts of the oarsmen in it, and a sailing vessel could not come into the port, slued round and dropped anchor on the roadstead. Strange drops in the sea level were observed on the same day on the Island of Skyros to the east of the Island of Euboea.

This is considered as the strongest shallow earthquake occurred in Greece in this century.  53 people were killed, 100 injured. The main shock was followed 13 later by an aftershock of Ms&#61;7.2 located about 5 km ENE of Santorini (Perissoratis, r468).\r\nThis earthquake activity was associated with a very large tsunami 25 m heigh, observed in the southern coasts of Amorgos, and which affected all other central and southern Aegean islands and the northern coasts of Crete, where its heigh was 1-2 m (Perissoratis, r468). The tsunami source was located in the deepest patt of the Strait of Amorgos (Soloviev, r643).\r\nThe severity of the waves of July 9, 1956, was not uniform. It varied greatly from place to place and over rather short distances. Waves up to 15 m in height were observed and many casualties were reported. The area affected by the waves exceeded 40,000 square miles and the distrubance of the sea lasted over 24 hours (Ambraseys, r457). (reference #4139)\r\n<p>The tsunami caused the greatest damage on the Island of Kalymnos because the main settlements of the island were grouped on the shore facing the wave source. The sea in the town of Pothea at first receded, and then rushed onto the coast in the form of a large crest and flooded the town completely. The rise of water was 2.5m, but the pressure of the water current was very strong. The port constructions and houses within the 90 m wide coastal strip suffered\r\nsignificantly. Over 30 fishing boats and one large sailing boat were thrown out onto the dry land and smashed. The sea receded and rose three times during the first hour. Various fragments and objects were carried 1.5 km deep onto the\r\nisland; one person was lifted up by the wave and carried 1 km onto the dry land, <b>three people were drowned</b>; a large area of topsoil was washed away.

Most of the fatalities were residents of the coastal villages of Pagadian. A total of 49,848 people lost their homes. Of the 11 coastal villages in Pagadian, Santa Lucia was the hardest hit because it was more populated and several communities are situated in the mangrove areas.

        "comments": "1977, August 19. A catastrophic earthquake shook Sumbawa Island. It covered an extensive area from the southern coast of Indonesia to the northwestern coast of Australia. A large tsunami was produced. The first press reports announced waves 30 m high in Indonesia and 8 m high in Australia Apparently, these figures were exaggerated. A group from the International Tsunami Information Center\r\nvisited the coastal regions of Sumba, Sumbawa, Lombok and Bali Islands to assess the destruction and wave run-ups, and to obtain other detailed information from local people. Inaccessible areas on the southern coast of Sumba and\r\nSumbawa islands were photographed from the air. Information was processed that had been gathered by the Indonesian military, search and rescue parties, provincial administration, and by medical teams visiting accessible areas in the coastal villages to offer help and assess the extent of loss of property and life. These records were supplemented by radio broadcast accounts from individual\r\nsettlements. <p>The southern coasts of the islands, with the exception of Bali, is sparsely populated. Villages are generally small and scattered. Hence the loss of human life was not high. According to incomplete data, over 180 people were killed and 3,900 were left homeless. Fishing boats and equipment were lost. For a large part of the Indonesian territory, which had sustained heavy damage from the tsunami, no information is available on the height of the rise in the water level. However, in the accessible region of Sumbawa Island, preliminary information reported that the tsunami reached a height of at least 15 m above the\r\nhigh-tide mark and inundated the island up to 500 m inland.\r\n</p><p>According to eyewitness accounts, the tsunamis appeared on the Indonesian coast about an hour or two after high tide, beginning with an ebb, which soon left a 100-200 m wide drained belt. This was followed by three large waves with a period of about 5 min or less. The first wave was the\r\nhighest and most ferocious. Several witnesses noted the duration of agitation of the sea although most made no mention of it. An unusual phenomenon occurred during the time interval between the earthquake and the arrival of the tsunami. Residents of villages in the Sumbawa and Lombok Islands thrice heard a sound at intervals estimated from a few seconds to 1 min and more. It was diversely described as sounding like a bomb explosion or a sonic boom. The sound\r\nreportedly emanated from the epicentral area. Nearly every village reported that the water became black and some reported a rise in temperature and an unpleasant smell. The tsunami reached a height of more than 10 m along the coast of Sumbawa. The main destruction was observed on the Sumbawa and Lombok islands.</p><p>The tsunami was also observed on the northern and western coasts of Australia. It was reported that on-the Australian coast, as on the Indonesian coast, three waves appeared, the first being the largest. Agitation of the sea continued for several hours. In Dampier the wave reached a height of 2 m; in Port Sampson it varied from 2 to 4 m; in Cape Leveque it reached 6 m. The arrival of the tsunami coincided with an observable ebb and a low tide in many places. These factors weakened the overall effect of the tsunami. Evidently, no lives were lost in Australia although there was one report of a person drawn into the sea by waves.</p><p>(above from reference #417)\r\n</p><p>A magnitude 8.0 Ms earthquake south of Sumbawa Is generated a tsunami that completely destroyed several villages. At least 100 people were killed, 89 reported missing and 75 injured. Most of the casualties and damage were caused by the tsunami. (reference #1053).\r\n</p><p>$1.2 million damage, 185 killed, 3900 homeless. (reference #1250)\r\n</p><p>On an inaccessible section of Sumbawa Is, a preliminary study indicates that the waves reached at least 15 meters above high tide, and penetrated about 500 meter inland in some valleys.

The maximum runup/wave height was reported to be 2 to 3 m, and inundation and coastal flooding extended up to 100 m inland in some locations. Both coseismic coastal uplift and the presence of fringing offshore reefs appear to have provided protection against major runup effects in some coastal areas. Elsewhere, runup effects were amplified at river mouths due to differential compaction of unconsolidated sediments.

Credible re-ports from residents in coastal towns and villages observed the sea receding 50-150 meters from the shore almost immediately after the earthquake. A 150-m recession and estimated 3-m high wave, was reported by General Magsino, a participant in the US-RP &#34;Balikatan&#34; Exercise, who ordered everyone to immediately evacuate to high ground. Two boats were damaged when the waves returned after a few minutes. In Maitum, the sea receded 300 m from the shore and the onrushing waves destroyed a pump boat; dead fish were observed soon after. In Kiamba, the sea receded 5-8 m and then rose back again, and people fled to the mountain. Subsequent tsunami modelling in collaboration with JICA expert Dr. Yuchiro Tanioka predicted 3-m high tsunami in Palimbang followed by a recession a minute after the earthquake, which were consistent with eyewitness accounts and damage reports.

Eyewitnesses interviewed by telephone the day after the earthquake reported NO tsunami in Manzanillo (report from Oceanographic Institute of the Navy), NO tsunami along the coast of Jalisco (reports from Barra de Navidad and Melaque) and NO tsunami at the Port of Lazaro Cardenas, Michoacan (report from the Captain of t he Port). Note that it was night at the time of the earthquake, which made it difficult for eyewitnesses to observe sea level fluctuations that did not overpass the higher part of the beach (the winter berm) which is on the average 1-2 meters above the high tide level along the coasts of Jalisco, Colima, and Michoacan. A field survey was conducted on January 26-28 along the coast, from La Manzanilla-Jalisco to San Juan-Michoacan, to seek tsunami traces and to determine how the people living near the coast responded to the possible tsunami. Results of the survey confirmed that no tsunami flooding occurred along the entire surveyed coast. It was also confirmed that the height of the tsunami along the coast was approximately the height of the high tide, as recorded in Manzanillo, and that it was difficult for the untrained eye to observe sea level fluctuations within the tidal range.</p>",

Apollonius, an eyewitness to the event, relates that, about midday, an earthquake shook the whole island and that at Leben, on the south coast of the island, south of Gortyna, the sea receded about 7 stadia (1.3km). He adds that travelers arriving from Cydoniatis (modern Chania) in the western part of the island reported that at the same time an island rose out of the sea between Thera and Crete.\r\n<p>The date of the event is not given, but Apollonius was in Sparta until the end of the winter of AD 61 and in the spring of the following year, AD 62, he proceeded to Crete. Although it is not known how long he stayed on the island, he arrived in Rome early in AD 64 or possibly, at the latest, in AD 66. There is no literary evidence that the shock caused any damage on the island; had it been serious, it would have been mentioned by Apollonius.\r\n</p><p>Archaeological evidence suggests some destruction at Gortya but this is dated vaguely to the period of Nero or Flavius (Di Vita 1986).\r\n</p><p>With few exceptions modern writers assign this event to AD 46 and associate it with the eruption of the volcano of Thera, for which there is no evidence.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #9116)\r\n</p><p>62 A.D. Earthquake 35 deg 12 min N, 25 deg 06 min E, magnitude 6.9. This earthquake has traditionally being dated to 46 AD associated to the formation of the island Thia as the effect of the volcanic activity of Santorini, during the reign of the imperator Claudius.  Some recent historical, archaeological and seismological studies tend to date it to 62 or 66 AD. Strong earthquake affecting Crete accompanied by a sea withdrawal. At Leben, southern Crete,  the sea withdrew for about one mile. (reference #4139)\r\n</p><p>62 A.D. (possibly 46 or 66).

There remains, however, to identify the island alluded to by Apollonius, which should have been connected with the sea-wave at Leben. For this, we resort to Bursian (1862, p. 522) who very logically\r\nsuggests that there might have been a volcanic shoal or islet near Thera (Santorini) which following the behaviour not so uncommon with islets around Thera, sunk shortly after it emerged from the sea. As for the origin of the seismic sea-wave observed at Leben, we may say that is was of volcanic nature.

Many other misfortunes occurred, both on land as well as at sea. Springs ceased to flow and new ones burst forth. Trees were flung up roots and all and landslides changed the shape of mountains. From the sea dead fish was hurled violently on shore and many islands were inundated; and when the sea retired sailing ships were left standing on shore.

The earthquake generated a tsunami that was observed in Acapulco and <strong>tore 11 men to pieces</strong> and left them to hang between the beams of a rather high bridge 6 km from the sea. The few who were saved were <strong>injured</strong> and very frightened. A galleon from the Philippine islands was riding in the harbor of Acapulco at a depth of 18 m. During the ebb tide, the water shallowed to 8.5 m. The city was destroyed. The wave was also observed in the region of Pochutla, Tehuantepec and other settlements in the state of Oaxaca.

Mallet gives both Mar. 14 and Mar. 18 but points out events on the two dates were probably the same.

A wide variety of sources were suggested by early investigators for the August 1872 tsunami, but Cox (Reference #65) determined from the difference in the tsunami arrival times at San Francisco and Honolulu that it originated on the Pacific shelf and slope of the eastern Aleutian Islands. The marigraphic evidence of its arrival at St. Paul Island permitted the time and location of its origin to be identified with greater certainty and precision than was possible earlier. Assuming the initial feature of the tsunami propagating southeastward to have been a crest, as considered most likely, its most probable origin time was estimated at about 18:06 UTC on 23 August, and the most probable position of the center of its origin area was estimated at about 52.2N, 168.5W. If the initial feature propagating southeastward was a trough, the origin time was most probably about 18:00 UTC, and the center of the origin area was most probably about 53.3N, 166.4W. The range of possible origin times is considered no greater than about 25 minutes (17:55 to 18:20 UTC). The range of possible longitudes of the center of the origin area is no greater than about 7<sup>o</sup> (164<sup>o</sup>W to 171<sup>o</sup>W); the range of latitudes is no greater than about 3<sup>o</sup> (51<sup>o</sup> to 54<sup>o</sup>N).<br />(above from Reference #1623) \r\n<p>1872, August 23, (mistakenly 27), 13:00 local time. At Hilo, with still weather, the water in the bay quickly and quietly rose, like the onset of flood tide...It again retreated quickly and quietly; thus, in 1 1/2 hours, 14 oscillations occurred, each subsequent one being weaker than the last. In the end, the water returned to its normal state. No earthquake was felt. It is possible that there was a tsunami with source off Chichizima Island. Sapper&#39;s (1927) compendium mechanically connects the mention of the tsunami with the mention of the eruption of the Mauna Loa volcano in the same year. A tsunami of remote origin was observed at Astoria, San Francisco and San Diego. There are not details available. Almost at the same time, a weak tsunami was observed on the Hawaiian Islands (Reference #415).\r\n</p><p>Reference #542 lists 52N, 172W<br />Reference #237 lists 52.2N, 166.4W.</p>",

        "comments": "There was a very strong earthquake in western Canada and in the northwestern United States. In the epicentral zone, it lasted about a half minute and caused numerous slides and subsidences of the loose ground. Many points of low-lying accumulative coastal relief forms: beaches at steep cliffs, spits, etc., disappeared. \r\n<p>The end of the spit, which cuts off Deep Bay, disappeared under water. The depth of the water to the north of the spit increased from 1.5 to 30 m. Apparently, the wave resulting from this slide reached the lighthouse situated to the east on Sisters Rock. Acoording to the lighthouse attendant, a wave 2-2.5 m high rolled onto the little island 7 minutes after the earthquake; a second wave 0.25-0.5 m high moved in at a distance of 30 m from the first; the velocity of the waves was 10 knots.\r\n</p><p>A section of coast with a pier on Goose Spit which cuts off the entrance to Comox Harbor, subsided more than 0.5 m. Waves about a meter high were observed near the slide which occurred here.\r\n</p><p>Some sections subsided on Rebecca Spit, which cuts off Drew Harbor on the eastern coast of Quadra Island. According to a forest worker, a moment after the earthquake, the water level oscillated between the high and low tide marks at another place on this island. The water, which had been clear, became turbid. The fish did not bite for two weeks. A large tract of agricultural lands on Reid Island dropped 6-9 m.\r\n</p><p>In Alberni Bay opposite Franklin Creek, the water increased more than 30 m in depth. The underwater cable was broken and partially buried by detritus. In the words of an eyewitness, a roller 6-9 m high, arose on the surface of the water here. The roller then scattered along the axis of the bay and turned into small tidal waves, which were observed on its shores.\r\n</p><p>According to Hodgson (reference #2598), who carefully examined the epicenter zone of the earthquake, there were no real tsunami waves. Only these local waves arose, which were generated by collapses and suspension currents. A distinctive feature of this earthquake was the almost total absence of recurrent shocks.\r\n<br />(above from reference #415)\r\n</p><p>Based on dendrochronological analysis, tsunami deposits and aerial photographs Evans states: The 1946 Vancouver Island earthquake (M &#61; 7.2) triggered a rock avalanche from the north face of Mount Colonel Foster, central Vancouver Island, British Columbia. The resultant displacement wave ran up a maximum vertical distance of 51 m on the opposite shore and the wave crest was about 29 m high when it spilled over the lip of the lake. Water displaced during the event destroyed forest in the upper reaches of the Elk River valley up to 3 km from Landslide Lake.

In Fatsa, a harbor on the Black Sea coast of Turkey, the sea receded 50 m from the shore. Then the sea dashed up the shore as far as 20 m above the normal water level [inundation]. The wave action slowly diminished until the sea returned to its normal state. A small tsunami reached the Black Sea coast of the [former] USSR and was recorded by tide gauges. These waves were recorded by almost all of the tide gauge stations on the Black Sea coast of the Crimea and the Caucasus.  The tsunami began with the rise of the sea level in all places except Batumi. Batumi was the nearest [former] USSR tide gauge to the epicenter of the earthquake. The comparison of the calculated wave travel-time data with the observed\r\ndata suggests that the source of the tsunami should have been either on the shore of the Black Sea near the coast of Turkey, between Batumi and Sinop, or inland. It is difficult to say anything definite about the mechanism of generation of this tsunami. It is not known whether it was\r\ngenerated by tectonic movement, or as that of a secondary phenomena, such as the landslide pointed out by B.

The ships &#34;Northumberland&#34; and &#34;Sandbury&#34; were shaken so strongly that the sailors were tossed from their berths. The tremors were felt by Raffles, who was onboard a ship 350 km (200 miles) from the coast of Sumatra. At Fort Malboro, a very strong shock occurred at night. One of the eyewitnesses who described the earthquake was thrown from his bed, and the wall of the home partly collapsed. At dawn, it was found that the sea had retreated far from shore and that all the ships riding in the roadstead had sat on the bottom. Soon thereafter the sea returned, surging in with great force and washing away everything in its path. The water advanced so far inland that a bridge was inundated. At Bengkulu, the shocks lasted at least until April 8, the postdate on the letter.</p><p><i>Reference #42:</i><br />1818, March 18, Sumatra, Bengkulu (3 deg 48 min S., 102 deg 15 min E.).

No earthquakes recorded to justify the anomalous event. Bedosti (ref #9286) hypotesises that a possible cause is a submarine landslide beneath the 200 m isobath more or less between Termoli and Vasto. Mosetti (anonymous)also suggests the occurrence of a submarine landslide in the Adriatic sea. \r\nThe following information is taken from Bedosti (ref #9286).\r\nThe oscillations period was about 10-15 minutes.\r\nAt Giulianova the sea withdrew by about 50 m at 11h 59m am and it came back 6 min later surpassing the normal level by about 60 cm. Oscillations repeated many times with period of 15 min and amplitude of 60 cm in the harbour until 5h 30m pm.\r\nAt Ortona only one oscillation observed, starting at 11h 30m am with a withdrawal of 15 m. The water came back at 12h. \r\nAt Bisceglie the sea withdrew by 2-3 m at 6h 30m and then it flooded the beach by  200 m. The maximum height was 50 cm. Two fishing boats broke their mooring.\r\nAt Molfetta at 5.00 am 10 m of withdrawal. The period was 5 min. \r\nAnomalous oscillations also observed at Fossacesia, Vasto, Termoli, Campomarino and Trani at different times. \r\n\r\nSome newspapers report detailed description of the phenomenon:\r\nAt Termoli the sea withdrew for tens of metres leaving the harbour dried and then violently came back; some swimmers referred that the sea water suddenly became cold and immediately after became also turbolent and strongly agitated (Anonymous).\r\nAt Bari the sea water suddenly witdrew many times leaving the seafloor dried; some moored ships in the harbour went aground and some fish was found on the beach (Anonymous). \r\nParenzan (ref #9287) reports that at Bari and Vieste the sea suddenly withdrew for about 50-100 m leaving boats aground and after a few minutes the sea violently inundated the shore with very high waves, causing damage to the boats and some injured people. The sea water swept away the beach-umbrellas.\r\nIn many islands and places along the Yugoslavian coasts the sea water suddenly rose; at Vela Luka (Cursola island) the waves was 8 m high inundating the first floors of  all the buildings on the shore. Many ships suffered severe damage and the sea water flooded the cost for 650 m inland (Anonymous) \r\nAlso at Dubrovnick, Caltaro and at the Iissa island anomalous waves were observed (Anonymous).\r\n<p>(above from reference #4139)\r\n</p><p>June 22, 1978.

We re-examined Lisitzin (1974) and the actual entry for this event reads: \u2018\u2018World famous strategists were also unable to escape it [the tide! \u2013 our italics]. Various historical authors have mentioned the amazement of Alexander the Great and his army, when during the illustrious campaign to India in 325BC they experienced for the first time in their lives sea \u2013 level variations caused by tide and noted the disastrous consequences of this phenomenon on the Macedonian fleet, anchored in the estuary of the River Indus\u2019\u2019 (Lisitzin 1974, pp. 259\u2013260). Here, quite clearly Lisitzin is discussing the effects of the tide on the Macedonian fleet. Tidal variations would have been unusual to Alexander the Great because of the enclosed nature of his familiar Aegean Sea where tidal variation is highly restricted. <strong>It is therefore, incorrect to interpret this event as a tsunami</strong>. (reference #2725)</p><p>Dominey-Howes et al. (2006) (reference #2725) have stated that tidal variations would have been unusual to Alexander the Great because of the enclosed nature of his familiar Aegean Sea where tidal variation is highly restricted. Thus, they concluded that it is incorrect to interpret the event of 326 BC as a tsunami. <strong>Nonetheless, we believe that normal ocean tides do not have sufficient power to destroy a military fleet.</strong> In addition, Dominey-Howes et al. (2006) have referred to only one document (Lisitzin, 1974), which is not a primary source. To address such an ancient event, more archival research should be done and, if possible, primary sources must be evaluated. <strong>Therefore, it seems too early to qualify the event of 326 BC as a non-tsunami event. </strong>The following historical account, which narrates the Alexander\u2019s military expedition to western India, supports our interpretation of the 326 BC event as a tsunami: &#34;About dawn they put out to sea, and were met by so violent ebb that three of the ships ran ashore and were held hard and fast on dry land, and the rest only just sailed through the surf and got safe into deep water.

This occurred on Sunday about midnight and was preceded by a strong earthquake. The sea was calm at that time. The people had just recovered from the shock and had begun to lie down again to sleep, when.. .they noticed a rapid advance of the water through the forest which lies between the seaside and the residential structures . . . . It seems that there were six or seven waves of different intensity, one after another. The middle one was the strongest. The people scrambled up the steep slopes behind the homes and came down between floods to save what they could. The documents were in a steamer trunk and I was able to save it, but the bulky diary and the books resting on a table by the wall, unfortunately, were washed away and lost&#34; (Tanakadate, 1940).

(2009) documented instrumental observation of the 2008 waves by maregraphs over an 850-km stretch of coastline extending from Luderitz, Namibia, in the north to Granger Bay near Cape Town in the south. </p><p>Based on the timing of the largest waves, Hartnady et al. (2009) proposed to locate the source of the main component of the tsunami around 28:5 S; 13:2 E, with an origin time of 23:00 GMT on August 20, 2008. Noting the presence of the Chamais Slump in the proposed source area, and the existence of documented gas hydrate structures in a structurally similar area 260 km to the southeast (Ben-Avraham et al. 2002), Hartnady et al. (2009) suggested to interpret the 2008 waves as due to a prolonged episode of slumping triggered by the destabilization of gas hydrates, and reaching its climax 24 h after it started.\r\n</p><p>However, Hartnady et al. (2009) noticed that barometric records at Port Nolloth showed signals inversely correlated with sea level residuals, speculating that while the ocean waves may have been driving the atmosphere, the opposite, i.e., a meteorological origin of the 2008 waves, might also be true [C. Hartnady, pers. comm., 2013]. </p><p>(all above frome reference #11087)\r\n</p><p>An undersea earthquake is believed to have triggered a mini-tsunami off the Cape west coast last week, causing noticeable fluctuations in tidal patterns, the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) said yesterday. The earthquake caused a mudslide, which in turn caused the tsunami, said NSRI spokesperson Craig Lambinon. The tidal changes caused damage to some factories in St Helena Bay. &#34;You get about five earthquakes around the world every day, so it is not unusual - it&#39;s just that it came without warning,&#34; said Lambinon, adding that the quake was not severe enough to warrant a tsunami warning.

The bow anchor chain was parted, the after mooring chains tore the whole starboard quarter out, and the ship was washed onto the shore. The ship was repaired and got off but the anchors and mooring chains were buried under 7 ft of sand. (Wallace, F. W. 1927,  reference &amp; extract given by Rhys Richards]\r\n</p><p>According to Wallace (1929), who appears to have accessed the original journal of the voyage of the Margaret Rait in New Zealand waters, records that at some time between February and July 1839: &#34;while lying partly dismantled at Wyacava [Richard&#39;s interpretation: Waikawa, Southland], a sudden increase in the tidal current parted the bow anchor chain, and the after mooring chains, tore the whole starboard quarter out and the ship went ashore. The vessel was eventually repaired and got off, but the anchors and mooring chains were buried under seven feet of sand and the crew had to dig them out.&#34; Assuming that the sailors of the time were completely familiar with tide times, local tidal eccentricities and vagaries of the weather, it is difficult to find an explanation for the quite damaging effects given here. A tsunami is a credible explanation, not only of the sudden change in tidal current but also the burying of the anchors and mooring chains in sand and the beaching of the vessel. \r\n</p><p>According to the Department of Conservation website: &#34;The first Europeans in the area were sealers and whalers. A short-lived whaling station was established just inside Waikawa Harbour entrance in 1838. It was abandoned by 1844.&#34; The likely source of this information is McNab (1913).\r\n</p><p>There are no known local earthquakes (NZ National Earthquake Information Database), no record of any sea level disturbances elsewhere noted in McNab (1913) and no regional or distant source tsunami that could be a source of a tsunami in ITDB (2004) database. Nevertheless, the descriptive account is credible, and hence a validity of 3 is assigned.</p>"

        "comments": "1965, February 19. The edifice of Yate volcano, a dissected stratocone in the Andean Southern Volcanic Zone, has experienced multiple summit collapses throughout postglacial time restricted to sectors NE and SW of the summit. The largest such historic event occurred on 19th February 1965 when ~6.1x10<sup>6</sup> m<sup>3</sup> of rock and ice detached from 2,000-m elevation to the SW of the summit and transformed into a debris flow. In the upper part of the flow path, velocities are estimated to have reached 40 m s.1. After travelling 7,500 m and descending 1,490 m, the flow entered an intermontane lake, Lago Cabrera. A wavemaker\r\nof estimated volume 9<u>&#43;</u>3x10<sup>6</sup> m<sup>3</sup> generated a tsunami with an estimated amplitude of 25 m and a run-up of ~60 m at the west end of the lake where a settlement disappeared with the loss of 27 lives. The landslide followed 15 days of unusually heavy summer rain, which may have caused failure by increasing pore water pressure in rock mechanically weathered through glacial action. (reference #10345)\r\n<p>Yate volcano is a late-Pleistocene, glacially dissected basaltic-andesite stratovolcano with Holocene parasitic vents... No historical eruptions are known from Volc\u00e1n Yate, although the fresh morphology of its satellitic cones suggests an historical age. A non-eruptive volcanic landslide in 1965 produced a debris flow that reached Lake Cabrera, causing a tsunami that destroyed a settlement and caused 27 fatalities. (reference #2432)</p>"

        "comments": "October 16, 1979, 14h00m (local time). Ligurian Sea, France. Waves of the tsunami type suddenly beat down on\r\nFrench Riviera. The sea receded 300 m on the shore between the beach of La Salis to the south of Antibes and the vicinity of Nice, i.e. over a distance of 60 km, and then it returned with two crests 10 m high. Six people were killed and three were lost. Numerous coastal buildings were damaged, many cars were smashed, boats that had been moored were torn away and carried off to sea. Repeated oscillations of the sea level continued for over 4 hours along a 100 km stretch of coast. The waves were not preceded by an earthquake, but an embankment 300 m long, which had been erected in the delta of the River Var\r\non an underwater platform, disappeared into the sea in a matter of minutes practically at the same time as the waves. It was therefore assumed that the oscillations of the sea level were caused by a powerfid underwater landslide. The collapse of the embankment alone seemed to be insufficient to generate the splash of the water observed. The bathymetric survey conducted by the\r\nhydrographic service and by other organisations of France revealed considerable depressions in the river bottom on the eastern edge of the underwater canyon of the River Le Paillon and on the western edge of the canyon of the River Var. A landslide of the vanished material of 400 million m<sup>3</sup> in volume could easily have caused the waves observed. The underwater telephone cables, belonging to Italy, from Genoa to the Balearic Islands and from Genoa to Sassari on the Island of Sardinia were torn at 17h45m and 22h, respectively, on October 16; the sites of gaps were located 80 km and 110 km to the south of Nice, respectively. The first cable was damaged along a distance of 80 km, the second along a distance of 30 km. The\r\ncables from Cannes to L&#39;le Rousse (the Island of Corsica) and from Barcelona to Pisa did not suffer. (reference #2130)\r\n<p>A submarine slope failure occurred during the construction of the Nice new harbour. No seismic event recorded. Except one person in Antibes, the victims were working men on the building site. This gravitational submarine sliding generated a tsunami observed by several witnesses in the Baie des Anges. The maximum effects were observed 10 km from the building site near Antibes, that was inundated (one person killed). Wave heights of about 1 m observed. At La Salis (close to Antibes), witnesses reported a first wave of about 50 cm, 5 minutes after the landslide. This wave was followed by three 3 m high waves with a period of about 8 minutes. At the harbour of Saint Laurent du Var water went down (about 2 m) 1 minute after the landslide and then went up with an amplitude of 1 m.\r\nThe tide-gauge records of Nice and of Villefranche show that the first wave is a trough of about 10 cm. The maximum recorded wave amplitudes do not exceed 10 cm in both harbours, whereas witnesses reported wave amplitudes of about 1 m. Tsunami intensity 3. (reference #4139)</p>"

Logs were swept up as far as the main road, and fish were washed up on to the banks. It was the first time that any of the residents had witnessed such an occurrence, and it naturally put them in a great state of excitement.

The primary observation of the May 2, 1922 event is a 0.64 m amplitude recorded at the Galveston tide gauge station. The original reference for this observation appears to be Parker (1922). The record is shown in Figure 3-1. The 1922 tidal disturbance is linked to an earthquake in Vieques only because of a note by Parker (1922) with regard to a single seismograph station. The NEIC historical catalog for the Caribbean and for the world, which lists earthquakes estimated to be larger than 6, does not mention any earthquake in Vieques. The Centennial catalog of Engdahl and Villase\u00f1or (2002), which is complete for\r\nmagnitudes approximately 6.5 and greater, does not list this earthquake either. Finally, Bill McCann&#39;s unpublished local catalog for Puerto Rico (written communication, 2005), does not mention an earthquake at that time. It is more likely that the tidal disturbance was the result of a source local to the Gulf of Mexico and Galveston. If it was a landslide or a slow earthquake offshore Galveston, it would not have been felt. This event does emphasize the\r\npotential hazard from local sources.\r\n</p><blockquote><i>Reference #541:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>1922, May 2. Validity 2.

Parker (1922, ref #1592), then the director of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, observed a train of three waves with a period of about 45 minutes on the Galveston tide record, followed eight hours later by a similar but smaller train of waves. He associated it with the Vieques earthquake occurring approximately four hours earlier. The earthquake was felt in Vieques in masonry buildings, but according to Campbell (1972, ref #1189), it was a slight shock lasting only two seconds, an unlikely candidate to produce a tsunami. Other sources for the waves are not known. (Parker, 1922; Campbell, 1972)\r\n</p><blockquote><i>Reference #1492:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>1922, May 2, 20:24 UTC. 18.4 N, 64.9 W. Validity 4.

A train of three waves with a 45-minute period was followed in 8 hours by a 28cm wave in a similar\r\ntrain of smaller waves. Parker associated it with an earthquake felt 4 hours earlier at Vieques, Puerto Rico. According to Campbell, the 2-second shock was slight and unlikely to have been the tsunamigenic source.

Environment Minister Barry Penner of the damage caused by a massive landslide near Chilliwack has found that a powerful wave washed out thousands of trees on the shoreline of Chehalis Lake. Penner said it looked like heavy rain and snow that fell last weekend triggered Monday&#39;s rockslide on one of the surrounding mountains.\r\nHe said it appeared 600 vertical metres of rock and trees slid down the mountainside, washed into the lake and triggered a giant wave. &#34;Unbelievable,&#34; Penner said after his visit to the area on Friday. &#34;It snapped tall standing cedar trees. Full, mature, strong cedar trees just got uprooted and thrown around like matchsticks.&#34; The wave, which officials estimated was several metres high, demolished trees several metres above the normal waterline, leaving only bare rock ringing the lake. &#34;Very impressive in terms of the power of nature--beautiful and terrifying at the same time,&#34; Penner said. A number of campsites along the lake were badly damaged by the wave, but nobody was in the area at the time. Officials are concerned that the thousands of trees washed into the lake could dam up a connecting stream and threaten to cause flooding in a nearby First Nations reserve, Penner said. Officials are also concerned about local fish stocks, Penner said. (reference #3720)</p>"

The waves were noted to be of unusual size, their crests reaching to the deck level, which was 3.3 m above the high water springs mark. The waves were only noted to have damaged the wharf and nothing is noted of their effect on the nearby shore, or anywhere else along the coast.  \r\nNo source is known for the large waves that damaged the wharf or the exact date on which the waves occurred, so association with distant/offshore meteorological conditions or with a local or distant earthquake is unknown. Locally, it was noted that there was a moderate easterly breeze, which only slightly roughened the sea. A large local earthquake can be excluded, and as the waves seem to have impacted at Tolaga Bay only and there are no events on the NGDC site that are large enough, a distance source can also be excluded. De Lange &amp; Fraser (1999) suggest a similar source to the March and May 1947 tsunamis (q.v.), which de Lange (1997) proposed were caused by marl diapirism. De Lange &amp; Moon (2004) have since proposed a landslide mechanism. However, the 1947 earthquakes have now been shown to exhibit many source and tsunami characteristics associated with \u0091tsunami earthquakes&#39; (Downes et al., 2001; Doser &amp; Webb, 2003).\r\nConsidering the possibility that the source of the waves in 1926-28 may be an earthquake, including mildly felt earthquakes like the 1947 events, the Poverty Bay Herald has been searched for a few days following known earthquakes in 1926-27, without finding any accounts of the damage to the wharf. However, the earthquake file is probably incomplete for this era.  Although a day-to-day check of the newspapers is probably warranted, it is problematic that the waves that damaged the Tolaga Bay wharf do not seem to have impacted elsewhere on the coast, noting the March 1947 event was observed along 120 km of coastline and the May 1947 tsunami along 80 km of coastline. Given this, and until such time as more evidence of a tectonically generated tsunami can be found, a few rogue waves or a localised meteo-tsunami seem to be the most probable causes of the waves, although one would expect a longer series of waves in the latter case and greater impact on the nearby shore.\r\nIn contrast to Fraser (1998), who assigns a reliability of 1 (&#61;certain tsunami) a validity of 2 (questionable, unlikely) following the NGDC classification is assigned.</p>"

Longer period waves begin on the 12th and the operator notes &#34;submarine disturbance.&#34; There is no known source for a tsunami. The onset is emergent and given the known storm conditions this is probably a storm seiche. Validity 1 (Reference #237).\r\n<p>The tide gauge at Sausalito (San Francisco region) recorded movements of the water, probably caused by an underwater earthquake. They began at 8:00, continued until 11:00 and amounted to nine waves only a decimeter (a few inches) in height (Reference #415).</p>"

In places the waves poured over the parapet of the breakwater, situated at a level 7 m 50 cm above the highest high tide mark. By 22:00 an unusual drop in sea level was recorded. It rapidly reached a mark 1 m 30 cm below the lowest low tide mark, which could be clearly fixed from the dried up joints between the individual blocks of the embankment, already erected in section G of the port. This caused great alarm among the population, since a rapid and unusual rise of water was to be expected whose consequences would be hard to predict. In fact, several minutes later, three waves fell on the breakwater at 4 minute intervals and poured over the parapet along its entire length at once, forming a stream from 3 m 50 cm to 4 m deep. These waves made the first breach BC in the structure. Less than 2 hours later, about midnight, a rapid fall in level was again recorded, accompanied by another rise in level and the formation of unusual waves, which made the second breach DE near the outer end of the breakwater. Somewhat later, more waves of the same kind beached the remaining sections AB and CD. Until 11:00 of the following morning, one could see unusual waves, flooding the upright piece of the breakwater DE, which held, since it was considerably thicker than all the rest of the structure. [There are no instrumental or macroseismic data indicating an earthquake. Apparently, this was a storm tsunami.] (reference #415)"

Great masses of smoke, water, and ashes rushed out of the lake, high up into the air, looking like towers.  Simultaneously there was a great commotion in the earth which stirred up the water in the lake, forming immense waves which lashed the shores as though a violent typhoon were raging. Their fury was such that in front of the Convento of Taal, and in other places of the beach, a strip of more than 10 brazas [16.7 meters] in width was engulfed by the water, and the church was endangered. On the following days, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, things continued in the same way, but by Sunday all the combustible material appears to have been consumed. This eruption killed all the fishes, large and small, the waves casting them ashore in a state as if they had been cooked, since the water had been heated to a degree that it appeared to have been taken from a boiling caldron. There was an all-pervading, pestilential stench of sulphur which greatly molested the inhabitants of the towns surrounding the lake. Sunday morning the sun broke through, but later torrential rains fell with thunder and lightning, some of the latter striking and the whole causing the greatest terror. Finally, however, the weather cleared, and of the whole tragedy there remained no other signs than the stench of sulphur and of the great quantity of dead fish cast upon the beach by the waves.

The shock almost totally ruined the greater part of Vostiza (Egio). Many houses, churches and towers collapsed with <b>little or no loss of life</b>, due to the fact that the people, warned by the foreshock, had taken refuge in the open. The shock caused serious damage to settlements on either side of the Gulf of Corinth, destroying a number of small villages on the northern coast of the Gulf opposite Vostiza and to the east as far as near Corinth. At Corinth some parts of the mosque of Sultan Mehmet II were damaged. To the west of Vostiza, in Patra, the earthquake caused great panic and some minor damage. The shock was strongly felt in Zante and throughout the Peloponnese.\r\n</p><p>Following the earthquake the sea in the Gulf of Corinth near Vostiza receded a great distance from the shore and, on returning with great violence, flooded the town three times. The third wave was so large that it reached the upper part of the town, beyond the Platanos, flooding the hill slopes to the south that overlook the town, washing away houses, stores and the customs house, and stripping trees of their leaves. Destruction was instantaneous and all sailing ships, boats and two large coasting vessels in the port at the time of the earthquake were totally destroyed. A seaman was carried by the waves 500 m inland and deposited unharmed on the hillside above the town. The sea wave added to the earthquake damage all along the central part of the Gulf of Corinth, where <b>many people and domestic animals were swept away and drowned</b>, the wave leaving behind it a great quantity of shells and dead fish, which littered the streets of Vostiza and of other villages along the coast.\r\n</p><p>Aftershocks continued for many weeks, causing the survivors to flee their villages, some of them moving permanently to Patras and Zante.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #9116)\r\n</p><p>1748, May 25. 38.3 N, 22.1 E, magnitude 6.8.

There was a destructive earthquake (37N 73W, mag 8.25) and tsunami in the center part of Chile with its source near Concepcion. </p><p>When the earthquake began, the whole surface of water in Concepcion (Talcahuano) Bay churned. The water darkened and gave off the very unpleasant odor of hydrogen sulphide. At approximately one half hour after the earthquake, the water in the bay receded to the point where all rocks and reefs were laid bare. Then it flooded once more and again receded so that vessels anchored in the bay appeared to be on dry land. Then a huge wave, from the island of Quiriquina, passed along the west shore of the bay, shearing off houses, uprooting trees, sweeping and carrying away everything that was movable... After several minutes a second huge wave appeared, approaching with an even more terrifying noise and violence than the first. Despite the enormity of the wave, its passage was less destructive since there was little left to destroy... After several minutes of tense expectancy, the inhabitants, who had taken refuge on higher ground, saw a third wave rolling between the island of Quiriquina and the mainland.. This wave appeared even larger than the two previous ones (by other accounts, it was somewhat smaller); it roared, dashing against obstacles and carrying along everything in its path. Then suddenly, as if repulsed by the foothills, the water receded, carrying away such a huge quantity of articles snatched from houses (partitions, furniture, etc.), that after the ebb, the whole ocean appeared to be covered with this wreckage. This disaster prompted the inhabitants to begin noticing approaching waves when they were still 5-7 km away from shore. </p><p>\r\nWaves were reported along the coast from Valparaiso to the island of Chiloe, a distance of more than 1000 km.\r\n</p><p>In Talcahuano Bay, one woman took to a boat with her son, but...the boat split and the <b>woman drowned</b>.  Near Niebla Port, Valdivia, a <b>man and a woman drowned</b>, apparently while collecting shellfish. </p><p>A segment of the Chilean coast in the earthquake focal zone was elevated. The bay at Talcahuano became shallower while the shore of the bay was lifted approximately 1 m. The coast at San Vicente rose 0.5 m. Santa Maria Island rose 2.5-3 m in the middle, 3 m in the north, 2.5 m in the south. Mocha Island rose 0.5 m. Then the elevated block slowly subsided and after 2 months the rise of the shores at Talchuano was reduced to 0.5 m. This subsidence apparently came to a stop simultaneously with the cessation of the aftershocks.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #3903:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>&#34;[Charles] Darwin described the tidal wave at Valdivia in 1835, again following a severe earthquake, as producing a quiet rapid rise and rapid fall...[At Concepcion] Thirty minutes after the earthquake the sea retired so far as to strand ships in 7 fathoms of water. All the reefs came into view. Then the return wave poured in thirty feet above high tide. Two others followed, some minutes apart, and progressively bigger. Then for several days there were small oscillations.&#34;\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #5324:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>1835, February 20th, 15:30 UTC. Central Chile: -36.5, -72.60.

There are no other reports of its observation outside of Chile. (ITDB, 2004) According to the ITDB (2004) database, the maximum observed run-up was 24 m at Coelema.</p>",

This was undoubtedly another large South Chilean shock, like 1575, 1737, and 1960; damage was comparable at Castro and Valdivia, and tsunami effects were more noticeable near the coast of Chiloe Island. The small amount of damage was attributed to the prevalence of timber construction. Montessus de Ballore claims that no &#34;maremoto&#34; was generated; yet the reports of tsunami damage on Samoa, Hawaii, and the coast of Japan must be connected with this event. Three successive fluctuations of the sea were observed in Ancud, but no wave was generated along the east coast of the island. On some flat shores the flooding extended up to 1000 yards inland, but no damage was reported.

A strong earthquake in Sanriku, Honshu Island, was felt over an enormous area and generated a catastrophic tsunami. According to official accounts, 10,617 buildings were washed away, 27,122 people died, and 9,247 people were injured... The tsunami was observed at least from the south of Hokkaido Island to the Bonin Islands, and also on the Hawaiian Islands and in North America. The Sanriku coast on a stretch of more than 400 km from Kinkazan Island in the south to Cape Shiriya in the north, suffered most of all.\r\n</p><p>At most places on the Sanriku coast, the tsunami began with a noticeable ebb tide. The exact time of the beginning of the ebb tide in the pleistoseismic area is unknown. According to the data of the hydrometeorological station at Miyako and the accounts of some eyewitnesses, the ebb tide began at nightfall, 15-30 minutes after the earthquake. The first tidal wave arrived immediately after 20:00. Consequently, the time difference between the beginning of the ebb tide and the arrival of the tidal wave was 30 minutes. The magnitude of the ebb tide naturally depended on the depth of the sea: in shallows, the water retreated a great distance, while at deep places, it retreated a small distance. Thus the water retreated 350 m at Horiuchi, 350-550 m at Ryoisi and Ooya, 500 m at Minatohama and 35 m at Tadaide.</p><p>Before the flood tide, a loud rumble like thunder or the noise of a squall could be heard from far at sea. The wave appeared simultaneously with the rumble on the coast of Kesen district, Iwate Prefecture, while it appeared soon after the rumble at other places. It is said that it was even heard in the prefectures of Akita and Yamagata.</p><p>It is also very difficult to establish the time of arrival of the tidal wave. The time, estimated by the hydrometeorological station at Miyako, 20:07 can be considered the most precise. According to the report of this station, the tsunami began 18 minutes after the first underground shock. A flood tide began at about 20:00, and a wave of great height, accompanied by a loud rumble, arrived at 20:07. Then the flood tides recurred six times: at 20:15, 20:32, 20:48, 20:59, 21:16 and 21:50. The second, the largest wave, washed away many people and carried\r\nhomes out to sea.</p><p>The average period of oscillations on the Sanriku coast after the arrival of the tsunami was about 15 minutes. The intensity of the waves began to gradually abate after 22:00, but small oscillations in sea level were still being observed at noon of the following day. The greatest height of rise of water was registered at Yoshihama and Ryori. The second, greatest wave was 24 m high at Yoshihama and the water rose 30 m at Ryori.</p><p>On June 15, the residents of the prefectures on the Sanriku coast were celebrating a national holiday in the streets; there was no work that day. After the ebb tide, with which the tsunami began, some hurried away from the water, but the majority continued the festivities. Practically the entire population of the flooded zone, except for a few individuals miraculously spared, perished in the roller which fell on the Sanriku coast. In addition, the fishermen who had gone out to sea were saved; returning home in the morning, knowing nothing about the events, they saw a horrible picture: the sea was strewn with debris of homes and corpses for several km from shore and heaps of ruins or bare expanses remained in place of the previous coastal villages and cities.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #150:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>1896, June 15, (19:33 local time). 39.5 N, 144 E, magnitude 7.6, Sanriku. 26,360 deaths (22,000 deaths by Yamashita), more than 11,000 homes wrecked and washed away.

Messina and Reggio Calabria completely destroyed, and also other villages: Faro, Ganzirri, S.Agata, Pace, Camaro, Gazzi, Cannitello, Villa S.Giovanni, S.Gregorio, etc. Partial destruction in most of Calabria and Sicily. In Messina all buildings ruined and after the shock a violent fire broke out. In Reggio Calabria all buildings ruined. The area of destruction was about 6,000 square km wide. More than 60,000 people died. Some strong foreshocks occurred on December 5, 6, 23, 25 and many aftershocks occurred till February 1909.</p><p>Violent tsunami in the Messina Straits that caused severe damage and hundreds of victims. In most places the first movement was a sea withdrawal (in some places about 200 m) for a few minutes. Then the sea flooded the coast with at least three big waves. The sea level oscillations lasted many hours, gradually diminishing. The tsunami reached its maximum intensity in the Calabrian coast near Pellaro, Lazzaro and Gallico and, in the Sicily coast, in Giardini and S.Alessio. It was very strong in the eastern Sicily coast and it was observed in the Tyrrhenian Calabria as far as Porto S.Venere and in Sicily as far as Trabia and Termini Imerese. In some localities the biggest wave was the first, while in others it was the second. The observed maximum wave height generally was an inverse function of the distance from the epicenter, but in the Strait this was masked by local amplification effects. A post-event survey allowed for damage estimates, flooding and run-up: it was ascertained that the tsunami caused many victims (the exact number is unknown, due to the catastrophic effects of the earthquake) and severe damage to buildings, ships, boats and nature. The tsunami involved mainly the eastern Sicily coast but also the southern and the northern ones.</p><p>At Messina the first sea movement was an ingression. The wave inundated many places causing severe damage to harbor infrastructures, boats and houses. All piers in the harbor lowered and some of them collapsed. Most damage in the southern beach of the city, close to the Portalegna stream. The english cemetery was completely destroyed. Many boats were carried onshore and destroyed. Many vessels moored in the harbor felt a sudden considerable sea level rise just a few minutes after the shock, and some of them broke their mooring. According to the Harbor Office report, the tsunami occurred 8 min after the shock. At least three huge waves were observed, the first was the biggest. Water height reached about 3 m.</p><p><i>Reference #516</i>:<br />On both sides of the Strait, many buildings were swept away by the waves. In Sicily, 79 people were drowned, and, on the Calabrian coast, more than 141.</p><p><i>Reference #5096</i>:<br />Guidoboni et al (2007) contend that <strong>80,000 people were killed by the earthquake, including as many as 2,000 who died as a result of the tsunami</strong>. Waves up to 12 m struck the shorelines south of Messina and south of Reggio Calabria, displacing the rubble from collapsed buildings and completing the destruction. All communications in the affected area were disrupted, and rescue operations had to rely on access from the sea.</p><p><i>Reference #10248</i>:<br />The 28 Dec 1908 Messina earthquake was one of the most destructive events in Italy and was associated with one of the largest tsunami inundations in recent history. About 60 000 people died because of the earthquake and about 1500 were killed by the tsunami. The cities of Messina and Reggio-Calabria were damaged extensively. The tsunami run-up was 3m in the Messina harbour and as high as 13m in the village of Pellaro, and the tsunami waves entered 200m inland in several locations along the coast of the Messina Straits.</p>",

In places the waves rose as high as 75 feet. \r\nMiyabe investigated the times of arrival of the waves as recorded on mareograms. At such distant points as San Francisco, Honolulu, Iquique, times of arrival check well enough for a wave starting from the earthquake epicenter at\r\nabout the time calculated as origin time from seismograms (which is good to within a very few seconds). However, the times recorded at Japanese tide stations are in part anomalous; at some of the more distant stations the tsunami was actually recorded as beginning 20 minutes earlier than at the nearest ones. This discrepancy may be due in part to seiches started by the seismic waves in the ground; Miyabe prefers to conclude that the tsunami probably did not originate from a point. In so great an earthquake, which almost certainly involved extensive faulting or block movement, this is to be expected. Omote proposes that there was an earlier wave originating around the margin of an area several hundred kilometers wide and a later wave from a more limited source of the order of 10 kilometers in diameter. An interesting detail was the recording at tide stations in Australia and New Zealand of waves, reflected from the American coast, traveling twice across the Pacific in about 47 hours. \r\n</p><p></p><blockquote>Reference #3909:</blockquote> \r\n<p>In Japan there was a great disaster in Iwate province\r\nfrom both earthquake and tidal wave, with reported loss\r\nof 1535 lives, 2000 wounded, 7930 houses, 1570 boats, and\r\nmillions of dollars of property damage at the ports of\r\nKamaishi, Miyako, Yamoto and Omoto. \r\n</p><table><tbody><tr><td><br /><b><h2>Different Reports of Effects</h2></b>\r\n<table><tbody><tr><td>\r\n<table><tbody><tr><td valign=\"bottom\"><b>Deaths</b></td><td valign=\"bottom\"><b>Missing</b></td><td align=\"center\"><b>Houses<br />Washed Away</b></td><td align=\"center\"><b>Houses<br />Destroyed</b></td><td valign=\"bottom\"><b>Reference #</b></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Severe damage</td><td></td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td align=\"middle\">1,522</td><td>1,542</td><td>4,034</td><td>1,817</td><td>150</td></tr><tr><td align=\"middle\">3,000</td><td></td><td>6,000</td><td></td><td>414</td></tr><tr><td align=\"middle\">2,986</td><td></td><td>4,086</td><td></td><td>1068</td></tr></tbody></table>\r\n</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table>",

A strong seaquake was felt on several American hydrographic ships, riding at anchor in the focal zone, particularly at Punta Burica and Montuosa Island. Apparently, a tsunami developed during the earthquake. At Puerto Armuelles, two large anchored buoys were displaced 300 m from the moorage\r\nout to sea, in such a way that their relative position did not change. The water level several times passed the mark of the highest high tides, although flood tides should have been small at this time of year. The main street of the Indian village was covered with water several times and a number of homes facing the sea were completely washed out. The well of the temporary tide gauge, set up at Puerto Annuelles by the American hydrographic expedition, was also washed away. Ten minutes after the earthquake, this instrument apparently began to register a tsunami beginning with a strong ebb tide wave. During all this, nothing unusual was observed on the surface of the water. (reference #415)",

        "comments": "The magnitude 9.0 Mw earthquake off the east coast of Kamchatka generated a 13-meter wave locally. The waves struck the Hawaiian Islands at 1:00 pm. Property damage from these waves in the Hawaiian Islands was estimated at $800,000 to $1,000,000; however no lives were lost. It also caused damage on the west coast of the United States and was observed on tide gauges throughout the Pacific Basin.\r\n<p>Reference #79 lists considerable damage and considerable loss of life in the Kuril Islands.\r\n</p><p>The waves of the tsunami of 4-5 November 1952 were noted from Iturup l. on the south (height of wave 2.5 m.) to the village of Shubertovo near Ust&#39;-Kamchatsk (wave height 0.5-1 m.) and had destructive force over an extent of more than 700 km. of the Pacific coast -- from Onekotan l. on the south to the Kronotsky Peninsula (Kamchatka) on the north. The morphology of the shores and the relief of the bottoms of bays and straits played an important role in the heightening of the waves upon their arrival at the coast; waves which were imperceptible to ships on the open ocean, at the coast transformed themselves into terrible battering rams, which not only destroyed installations but changed the coastal relief, washing away sandy soils and causing landslides... The greatest destruction and suffering of 4-5 November were caused by the tsunami which arose as a result of the earthquake and which took in about 700 km of the east coasts of Kamchatka and the Kuril Is. On the average the height of the waves on the coast reached 6-7 m. In Kamchatka and on the Kuril Is. destructive sea waves appeared 30-40 minutes after the earthquake. At most points the beginning phase of the waves was accompanied by a lowering of the level of the ocean. Hence it follows that\r\nthe actual moment of appearance of the waves on the coast occurred half a period earlier. (reference #4252)\r\n</p><p>Kurilske was about 15 thousand inhabitants, about 4 thousand perished, extensive destruction... (reference #9224)\r\n</p><p> Because of the absence of casualties in the far field, this event was often perceived as involving a deceptive\r\ntsunami, as no reports were available from the near field. The 1952 Kamchatka tsunami was, in fact, a closely\r\nguarded state secret in the then-USSR, especially since we now know that it had eradicated the sensitive naval\r\nbase at Severo-Kuril&#39;sk. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, information started to slowly trickle out\r\nin the form either of dissemination abroad of existing reports or of studies resulting from new research into this matter. Among the latter, Smyshlyaev (reference #11472) reported 7,802 civilian deaths in the Northern Kurils, and estimated that the total death toll in the city of Severo-Kuril&#39;sk, including military casualties, must have reached 10,000 and perhaps as high as 17,000, making the event by far the deadliest tsunami in the twentieth century. (reference #9223)\r\n</p><p>). Present day estimates based on the existed  data on population density in the area and available damage reports from some selected coastal locations show that  minimum number of victims was about 4000 people with estimated maximum as high as 14000 fatalities (Smyshlyaev, 2003). Based on this, the most realistic estimate for the fatality level can be adopted as 10,000 people, the majority of which (more than 99%) were killed by tsunami. (reference #11763)\r\n</p><p>The source of 1952 earthquake was located in two time zones. According to Greenwich (UTC), the earthquake happened on November 4 at 16 hours 58 minutes. In Kamchatka (&#43;12 hours) at this time was November 5, 4-58 am, and in Kuril Islands, which live in Sakhalin time (&#43;11 hours) was 3-58 am. So, local people from Severo-Kurilsk use the time 4 am for the earthquake (reference #12048)\r\n</p><p>View a calculated <a href=\"http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/seg/hazard/tsu_travel_time.shtml#Kam1952\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">tsunami-travel-time map</a>.</p>",

The earthquake occurred at night, and awoke only about 10 to 20% of the people. About 30 to 40 minutes after the earthquake, the waves (three distinct waves) began to arrive. Most of the people were still sleeping when the wave arrived, and the mostly-straw houses were washed away.\r\nAbout <b>223 people were killed, 15 were listed as missing, and 423 injured</b>. The tsunami <b>destroyed 1,500 homes, and 278 boats</b>. The most affected districts were Lumajang, Jember, and Banyuwangi. Most of the fatalities and damage was caused by a tsunami at the villages of Pancer, Lampon, and Rajekwesi in the Banyuwangi district, the most eastern of the districts.\r\n<p>At Pancer, an important village situated on sand dunes of a river mouth into the bay, more than 70% of the 1,000 buildings were destroyed but only 4% (122 people) of the 3,000 inhabitants were killed, and 15 were missing. All of the straw houses were destroyed, and most of the brick buildings were severely damaged. The second wave was the largest and penetrated 300 meters inland. Palm trees\r\nbetween the village and the sea helped to mitigate the wave damage although most were uprooted. The maximum runup height was 9.5 meters. The wave advanced up the river causing lateral flooding.

There were 35 fatalities and 40 straw houses destroyed some of which were 500 meters inland. The wave destroyed houses 500 meters inland. Most of the damage occurred near the river where there was significant erosion. The wave penetrated one km along the river. A maximum wave height of eleven meters was measured over a steep bank.\r\n</p><p>At Rajekwesi there were 1,200 inhabitants and 300 homes. Seventy percent of the homes were built with straw. There were 33 fatalities, 14 missing, and 70 homes destroyed. Eyewitnesses reported the first wave was about one meter high, and the second wave was six to seven meters high and had an inundation of 100 meters. There was large erosion of the beach and riverbank. Palm trees near the shore were uprooted. The straw houses were leveled, and all brick buildings were damaged. \r\n</p><p>At Watuula Village of about 600 inhabitants, 16 straw houses were destroyed, three fishermen were killed, and 30 boats were severely damaged.

A magnitude 7.1 Ms (Mw 7.1) (HRV) earthquake at 19:15 UT in the Verde Island Passage between Luzon and Mindoro Islands, Philippine Islands caused at least 87 dead and missing due to the earthquake and tsunami on Mindoro Island. Most of the casualties were children. Two hundred thirty-five people were injured. On Mindoro 797 houses were destroyed and 3,288 damaged and seven more houses were destroyed at Batangas, Luzon.\r\n<p>An international survey team with members from Korea, Thailand, the United States, and Philippines surveyed the tsunami effects on Mindoro from Calapan Bay to Subaang Bay, the southeastern coast of Luzon near Lobo, and the islands in the passage of Verde, Baco Island, Silonay Island and Anaganahao Island. A local tsunami occurred with a maximum runup of 7.3 meters on the southwest coast of Baco Island at Sitio Pino and 6.1 meters on the northern coast. Eyewitnesses reported the water first receded 45 meters. There were no deaths on Baco Island and only one home\r\ndestroyed. Three waves were reported with the second being the highest.\r\n</p><p>The tsunami produced a sound on its return like that of a landing jet airplane. It had heights of 1.5 to 4.0 meters along the northern Mindoro coast. One effect was the breaking loose of a moored, 4,000-ton barge in the Baruyan River sweeping it 1.6 km upstream. The wave penetrated upstream about two kilometers. This happened before the first tectonic tsunami wave reached the Mindoro coast and\r\nmust have been due to a local landslide generated tsunami.\r\n</p><p>The heights ranged from 2.3 to 4.2 meters along the Luzon coast near Lobo.

At Calapan the wave receded 100 meters and returned as a white line with a drumming noise. The tsunami was recorded on the marigram from Batangas, Luzon, with a height of about 20 cm.

It generated a tsunami that arrived at Eratini immediately after the earthquake. It had a runup height of 0.4-0.5 meters after a withdrawal of one meter a few minutes after the earthquake for a wave height (range) of 1.5 meters. (reference #1315)\r\n</p><p>On 15 June 1995, 00:16 GMT, a strong (Ms&#61;6.0) earthquake ruptured the western side of the Corinthos Gulf. The earthquake caused extensive damage in several towns and villages along both coastlines of the Gulf, the northern and the southern ones. The maximum intensity (VII&#43;) was felt in the city of Aegion, southern coastline, where the collapse of two multi-storied buildings caused a death toll of 26. Extensive coastal ground breaks and subsequent ground submergence were reported in both coastlines. In the northern coastline, a local tsunami wave was officially reported from the town of Eratini (peak-to-trough 1.5 m) being located in the epicentral area. The wave was observed immediately after the earthquake occurrence. Its maximum vertical run-up was of about 004-0.5 m, while a water withdrawal of about 1 m occurred a few minutes after the earthquake. The water disturbance lasted for about 12 hours. Damage was not reported. Judging from that no tsunami was reported from other coastal places of the epicentral or more remote areas it is tentatively concluded that the wave could be attributed to the reported massive sliding in the sea of unconsolidated sediments accumulated at the local river mouth. A similar mechanism of tsunamigenesis at the same place was considered in association with the earthquake (Ms&#61;6.3) of 6 July 1965. Tsunami generation from either seismic or aseismic sliding of coastal or submarine sediment masses is rather frequent in the Greek Archipelago, including the Gulf of Corinthos.

Given the large size of the two earthquakes occurring on November 16, it has been difficult to determine which seismic event caused what runup, as flooding and tsunami waves have been reported as inundating several coastlines. These include, unconfirmed reports of runup on the islands of Bougainville (Torokina reporting 2.5 to 3 m. runup) and Buka. In addition, it was reported a tsunami reaching Trobriand Islands (SW Solomon Sea) measured .3-1 meter. According to Rabaul Volcano Observatory (e-mail correspondence, Dec. 1, 2000) initial indications were that only the first large earthquake (4:55 UTC) caused a tsunami. But after reference to tide gauge records, it appeared most likely that it was the second earthquake (7:42 UTC) that created a tsunami. The inundation of a hardware store in Rabaul, occurring 20-30 minutes following the first earthquake, was most likely caused by a seiche. Runup of .9 meter was reported in\r\nRabaul. Because it was dark by the time the aftershock occurred it was difficult to verify when some coastlines were inundated. Follow-up confirmation reports and tide gage records have yet to be received. (reference #9795)\r\n<p>A magnitude 8.2 earthquake (04:54 UT) New Ireland, Papua New Guinea generated a damaging local tsunami at Kokopo and Rabaul, New Britain. The inundation of a hardware store in Rabaul that occurred 20-30 minutes following the first earthquake was most likely caused by a seiche. A runup of 0.9 m was reported in Rabaul. Tsunami damage was also observed along the southwestern coast of New Ireland, the west coast of Bougainville and on Buka. It was not certain whether the tsunami was the result of this earthquake or the aftershock that occurred a few hours later.

Run up heights on open coast were generally less than 1 m, but reached 1.5 m at Kauk and an estimated \r\n3-4 m in west-facing bays on the islands, and on the mainland coast immediately east of Boiken.\r\nThe higher run-up in the west-facing bays was a funneling effect. In both Victoria Bay and Mushu Bay, the larger of the west-facing bays on Mushu Island, observers saw the water circulate counter clockwise around the perimeter of the bay, and reach maximum height in the eastern extremity of each bay. Logs were washed ashore amongst the houses at Buruwan on Victoria Bay and 50 m of land was inundated. Logs, coral and a moored dinghy were washed ashore in Mushu Bay. The reason for the higher run-up east of Boiken is less clear, but perhaps was due to the funneling of the tsunami between the coast and the islands. Tsunami effects were observed as far east as Murik Lakes; where water washed through the villages at ankle depth. The villages are on a low sand bar. In the west, a repeated rising and falling of the water level in the Aitape River of the order of 1 m above normal water level was observed at 6.45 to 7 am. In Wewak too, there was a fluctuation of the sea level at 6:45-7 am, the water draining out into the bay then returning passively to flood across the road, before subsiding to normal level. The drop in sea level was estimated to be 2 m, and the rise above normal sea level, 1.5-2 m. The fluctuations at 6:45 am appear to have been a second and discrete tsunami event.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #11914:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>It is notable that the amplitude and effects of the tsunami  were greatest in the Boiken - Muschu Is. - Kairiru Is. area, about 70-80 km from the epicenter of the main earthquake and about 20-30km from the location of the CMT. In the area of maximum damage from earthquake shaking, between Boiken and the mouth of Hawain River, the tsunami was reported to have had turbulent, violent flow. At Victoria Bay at the eastern end of Kairiru Island, the tsunami was observed to approach from the southwest and swirled along the cost with an anti-clockwise motion depositing large logs and other debris. At these locations and on both northern and southern coasts of Muschu Island houses were swept away by the tsunami. These observations indicate that source of the tsunami was in this same general area, ie., the Boiken - Muschu Is. - Kairiru Is. area.\r\n</p><p>2002, September 8, 18:44:25.53 UTC. 3.260 South,  142.940 East, depth 13.0 km, 7.6 Mw HRV.

A tsunami with a maximum estimated wave height of 2 m caused damage to boats in the Balearic Islands, Spain, especially in Puerto de Mahon, where 10 boats sank. It was recorded on tide gauges at Palma de Mallorca, Spain; Nice, France; and Genoa, Italy. The tsunami was also observed on the coast of Alicante, Castellon and Murcia, Spain. (reference #1053)\r\n<p>Observed tsunami waves of up to 3-m height with a mean period of 10-12 minutes were reported on the southeastern coast of Majorca and Menorca, and in Ibiza in the Spanish Balearic Islands located about 250 km north of the epicentral region. The waves caused significant damage to hundreds of vessels in harbors and ports. On the Algerian coast in the epicentral region, eyewitness accounts report a 100-m recession of the sea in coastal sections of Algiers and Boumerdes, and fishermen in the port of Zemmouri-El-Bahri, reported a drop in water depth to less than 1 m with several boats ending up resting on the sea bottom before the water returned. Underwater telephone cables were severed by the earthquake and/or tsunami cutting communications between Europe and Asia, the Middle East, and the Pacific. (reference #3025)\r\n</p><p>The destructive Zemmouri earthquake of 2003 May 21 (Mw 6.8) occurred at 18:44 (GMT) along the coast, 50 km east of the city of Algiers, between the cities of Zemmouri and Boumerd\u00e8s. This shock, the largest felt in this region since the 1716 event, had the epicenter  located very close to the coast (about 4 km) and the earthquake produced severe damage and more than 2,000 victims. Two main phenomena were associated to the earthquake: shoreline uplift along 50 km and a tsunami, triggered either by the earthquake itself or by a submarine landslide. According to Dr. Yelles, director of the CRAAG center in Algiers, the tsunami waves were generated by a river sediment slide. In fact, the area is well known for a large sediment deposited by a river, a deposit which is highly unstable. Instantaneously with the Zemmouri earthquake, a tsunami was generated along the northern Algerian coasts. No run-up values were reported along the Algerian coasts, indicating that the tsunami waves, if any, were not high enough to inundate beyond original shoreline. \r\n(reference #4139)\r\n</p><p>A strong tsunami with sea disturbances observed along the Algerian coast, but with significant damage mainly in the Balearic Islands (Spain) harbours, affected the western Mediterranean following the 2003 Zemmouri earthquake (MW 6.9, Algeria). An average regional uplift of 0.55 m was measured along the shoreline in the epicentral area. Field observations, main shock and aftershocks characteristics are consistent with thrust along a \u223c55-km-long rupture, trending NE-SW, dipping SE. The seismotectonic parameters indicate a hypocentre 7-8 km deep and a possible fault break between 5 and 15 km offshore. Several tide gauges located in the western Mediterranean Coast indicated an average of 0.4 m of sea-level change with a maximum of 2 m in the Balearic Islands. (reference #12057)</p>",

There was a very strong earthquake, which affected all Ambon Island and adjacent islands and left human victims...</p><p>Immediately after the earthquake, a tsunami occurred on the entire coast of Ambon Island. The northwestern shore of Hitu peninsula suffered most of all, especially the region of Ceyt, between Lima (Negrilima) and Hila. Here the water rose 80-100 m that is, to the top of the coastal hills. The trees, including those in the clove plantations, which covered the calcareous coastal slopes at Mamala, Ela, Sinalo, Kaitetto, Ceyt, Loboleu, almost as far as Lima, were uprooted. Only the higher-lying plantations at Nausihola, Wakal and Hitulama escaped destruction.</p><p>Everything was so &#34;jumbled&#34; onshore that it was unrecognizable. In the region of Loboleu, a coastal strip with the width of a musket shot subsided. The shore became very precipitous between Cety and Hila and at Hila itself, part of the coast also collapsed into the water, carrying with it the settlements of Nukali, Ehalaa, and Wawani. In all, 2243 people died on Ambon island as a result of the tsunami.</p><p>According to eyewitness accounts, the water rose up like a mountain. First it inundated Loboleu, and then it split into three streams. One of them spread along the coast to the west to Lima and Urien, another to the east to Hila, and the third went out to sea, in the direction to Cape Ryst on Ceram Island, carrying with it trees, houses, domestic livestock and people. The movements of the water were accompanied by a very loud nose. The moving water was black, very dirty and evil smelling; its surface phosphoresced.</p><p>According to the eyewitnesses, the surface of the sea in the strait between Ceram and Ambon Islands, was calm, and it was agitated and made a deafening noise only off shore, to the distance of a musket shot. People in a boat not far from shore did not notice anything unusual in the state of the sea; the oscillations in its surface were just as weak and small as usual.

However, no attempt has been made to investigate this event further, particularly to answer why the extreme run-up was observed only on the northern coast of Ambon. Therefore, the primary source of the tsunami and earthquake remains open to question [...] More significantly, we have shown that the only way to explain the extreme run-up only on the northern shore of Ambon, and in particular the very narrow lateral extent along the coast over which it occurred, is by attributing the tsunami generation to a submarine landslide.</p>",

There are several accounts of sea level disturbances that have been interpreted as possible tsunami on three days during the 1848 earthquakes: October 16, i.e. the day of the mainshock; October 18 and October 19. According to Collinson (1848) &#34;eight hours after the first shock [which occurred on October 16 at 0140 local solar time], it being high water but neap tides, the tide rose in Wellington one foot [0.3 m] above ordinary spring tides&#34; i.e. the rise occurred on October 16 at about 9.40 am local solar time. Ironside&#39;s (1891) account indicating that &#34;the vagaries of the inflow and receding of the waters ... were remarkable&#34;, although included in the transcriptions is given little credence, as there is clear confusion in his full account of the earthquakes with the effects and uplift, and almost certainly the tsunami, that occurred in the 1855 earthquake. Hence, Collinson (1848) is the only contemporary account of a tsunami on the day of the mainshock, despite there being newspapers and other journal writers that recorded day-to-day events. The date in Collinson&#39;s account is almost certainly incorrect and should be October 18.\r\n</p><p>The lack of a tsunami being recorded at any time during the sequence of earthquakes, including the mainshock, is consistent with accounts written some years after the 1848. It is not clear whether these include locations other than Wellington. However, it is unlikely that a large tsunami and/or its effects, had they occurred near the source in Marlborough or along Wellington&#39;s southern coast, were not observed despite the fact that few people lived there. Further, the lack of large or even moderate tsunami near the source is consistent with the lack of an observable tsunami within Wellington Harbour. On the other hand, it cannot be entirely ruled out that a small tsunami occurred. If a tsunami had been generated by the mainshock, it would have arrived in the Wellington City area an hour or so after the earthquake, on an ebbing tide about 2 hours after low tide. The occurrence of low tide could have masked the occurrence of a small tsunami. However, as many people lived on the beach in Lambton Harbour, and as they were disturbed by strong earthquake shaking, damage and aftershocks, they would surely have observed and commented upon any unusual repetitive ebbs and flows of the sea, had they been obvious, that is, exceeding 20-30 centimetres. \r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #79:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>1848, Oct. 16-25 possible dates of tsunami. \r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #415:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>1848, October 16, 01:40 [local time]. On October 16 at 1:40 [local time] the first of a series of shocks occurred in the region of Cook Strait. Eight hours after the earthquake, during a high water slack period, the water level in Wellington had risen 0.3 m higher than the mark of the highest flood tide. This effect, however, could have been caused not only by the earthquake but also by a strong southeast wind blowing on the 15th and 16th. Unusual changes in the sea level were noted also in Nelson and Wanganui.</p>",

Everyone thought the ship was aground. Looking towards the shore, they saw the people rushing out of their houses. After an interval of 20 minutes, another shock was felt for about 20 seconds, and at irregular intervals shocks continued all day until 9 p.m., 32 distinct shocks being felt. The water receded out of the bay after the first shock, leaving the boats on dry land. The natives rushed out for fish, myriad of which were lying high and dry, but their sport was short-lived, as a tidal wave rolled in. Luckily for them the wave was not of great force or volume. After the first shock the lead over the stern showed the  three fathom mark awash, but the water came gradually back, and half an hour after six fathoms was obtained. The vessel was then shifted out half a mile into deep water. Captain Tornaros learned afterwards from Mr. Hernsheim that they believed the island Malapia had been lifted four feet. The report stated that the event occurred on Sep. 18 but the description of weather and time of occurrence suggest that the date given is one week in error - Author.\r\n</p><p>Remarks from New Britain Reperstshoh, AAAS Seismological Committee, 1902, p. 42: &#39;A terrific shock happened at 7.30. The earth felt as if it had been suddenly lifted up several feet and dumped down again with a thud. The disturbance lasted about three minutes. During the upheaval the sea receded fully 50 feet from the shore, and after an interval of ten minutes rushed in again. So great was the volume of water which receded that the German mail steamer Stellin, which was lying at anchor at Reperstshoh, distinctly touched bottom several times, to the great consternation of those on board&#39;.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #414:</i></blockquote>  \r\n<p>1900 Sept 11.

(ref #1053)\r\n</p><p>This was a \u0091slow earthquake&#39;, meaning that the rupture occurred more slowly and took longer than in a normal earthquake. Slow earthquakes usually occur at very shallow depths and produce greater displacements than normal earthquakes. As a consequence, they are more likely to significantly displace the seabed and generate tsunamis. In addition, the magnitude of slow earthquakes may be underestimated by traditional magnitude calculations because the energy they radiate is deficient in high frequencies due to the slower rupture speed. Further, the strongest energy release of the earthquake may occur minutes after the initial rupture and thus not be captured by the initial magnitude calculation. This event was also called a \u0091tsunami earthquake,&#39; which is an earthquake that generates a tsunami much larger than expected given the earthquake magnitude. \u0091Tsunami earthquakes&#39; are often caused by \u0091slow earthquakes&#39;.

Plutarch says that is took place about the time of the end of the war with Philip, in the winter of 198 B.C., or in O1.145.2 (198 B.C., Eusebius). Pliny&#39;s dating to O1.135.4 (236 BC) seems to be chronologically inconsistent and it may be disregarded since, in an early transcription of his work, events of the 14th Olympiad were dated O1.135. <p>Most writers (e.g. Strabo and Seneca), drawing from the earliest source, Posidonius (135-151 BC) do not associate this event with an earthquake or suggest that the eruption caused any damage in Thera or elsewhere. They say that midway between Thera and Therasia fires broke out from the sea and continued to burn for four days, so that the whole sea boiled and blazed, and that the fires cast up an island 12 stadia (2.2 km) in circumference, which was gradually elevated. They add that, after the cessation of the eruption, the Rhodians, who at the time held maritime supremacy, were the first to venture upon the scene and build a temple in honour of Poseidon Asphaleus on the island. \r\n</p><p>However, there is one source, belonging to the third century AD (Just. 219-220), which says that during the eruption a shaking was felt in Thera, thus conflating it with the earthquake in Rhodes. The sources adds that in Asia, on the same day as the eruption, the earthquake ruined Rhodes and many other cities.\r\n</p><p>It is rather improbable that this submarine eruption from the volcano at Thera would cause an earthquake that could destroy cities in Asia Minor and Rhodes, 250 km away, and that the Rhodians, if seriously affected, would spend money on building a temple in Thera after the eruption.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #9116)\r\n</p><p>198 B.C.

Guidoboni (ref#10420) interpret that the tsunami effect is confined to Acre, but it is reasonable to suppose that the tsunami affected more of the coast. Ambraseys (ref#9116) constrains the tsunami to Acre and suggests that it did not cause damage or loss of life inland. Shalem (ref#10422), however, suspects this description might have been duplicated from the 1068 event. Following the detailed analysis of Ambraseys (ref#3845) and Guidoboni (ref#10420), the tsunami can be constrained to the northern and central coasts of Israel only.<p>Regarding the cause of the tsunami, Amiran (ref#10419) mention a swarm of earthquakes during the winter of 1033/4, probably in the Jordan Valley, including the strongest shock on 1033 12 10 and another one on 1034 01 04. Ambraseys (ref#10421) and Ambraseys (ref#3845) also locate the earthquake in the Jordan Valley but date it on 1033 12 05. A detailed analysis by Guidoboni (ref#10420) suggests that the earthquake occurred on 1033 12 05, although Arabic sources give the date of 1033 12 05 as 1034 01 04. In their opinion, Perrey (ref#10418) dated this event to 1032 03 06, which is then further confused with 1033 03 06, the date of the earthquake that occurred in Constantinople. </p><p>(above from ref #10416)</p><p>1033, Dec 5. A damaging earthquake occurred in Palestine... In Acre the sea flowed out several kilometres before flowing back as a wave an hour later. Although it drowned some of those who were foraging on the seabed, there is no evidence that it caused destruction or loss of life inland.( ref #9116)</p><p>1032. An earthquake in Asia Minor, Syria, Palestine, Askabh, Jerusalem and Gaza, was accompanied by an earthquake wave in the Mediterranean. (ref #1222)\r\n</p><p>1033-1034. In Syria, 1/3 of Ramala was destroyed. In Jerusalem the walls collapsed and the temple was severely destroyed. In Ghaza the mosque and its minarets at El Gaalan were destroyed also upper part of lighthouse badly damaged. In Nablus 1/2 of the city fell down, many villages in El Badou were swallowed up in the ground. In Egypt the earthquake caused much damage. There were 70,000 victims. (ref #1222)</p><p>1034, Jan. 4. Tsunami on the coasts of Lebanon and Israel, Acre. (ref #15 and #20)</p><p>1034, Jan 4; or Mar 6, 1032; 1039; or May 1035. A strong destructive earthquake occurred in the vast region from Syria in the northeast to Egypt in the southwest. Half of the city of Nablus and 1/3 of the city of Ramallah were destroyed. In Jerusalem, walls were destroyed, the temple was badly damaged, other buildings suffered damage. In Gaza the mosque and the lighthouse were damaged, heavy damage was caused in Ashkelon. After one or several earthquakes the sea retreated from the shore and returned swiftly. Tidal waves were observed in Gaza and in Ashkelon. The seaport of Akko became dry for a long time, then it was half destroyed by a wave. (ref #2130)</p><p>1035, April or May. From the study of the available information on these individual earthquakes, it appears that there are at least four major distinct earthquakes that occurred between 1033 and 1035 AD. A third very strong earthquake occurred in April or early May 1035 AD and damaged the northern provinces of Syria. It appears that the April or May 1035 AD earthquake was responsible for the seismic sea-wave. During this earthquake, extensive faulting and probably some crustal deformation occurred in the Saida-Sur area. (ref #26)</p>",

Many houses collapsed causing a large number of deaths, and in many places large cracks opened into the ground, and clefts were formed. The sea overwhelmed many cities (Gallieni, lib. v, Q 2-6). Trebellius says also that these earthquakes occurred while a great pestilence raged in the east. The pestilence, which is also mentioned by Eusebius (Eccles. History, lib. vii, Q 22) together with the fact that at that time Gallienus was consul, fixes the time of this event in 262 AD. It does not seem certain that these earthquakes happened at the same time in Asia Minor and in Lybia. Nor that the inundations alluded to by Pollio took place in Asia Minor.

To the descent of these winds upon Lake Bombon are probably due, at least in part, the tremendous waves which formed on the latter and, as we shall see, considerably augmented the destruction and loss of life on all the shores of the lake. \r\n<p>The second zone, or area of partial destruction, within which the fall of ashes, though less heavy, was still very considerable, comprises all the shores of the lake. Within it there were likewise some victims who were carried off by the tremendous waves which, according to the statements of some survivors, swept over places 3 meters above the\r\nordinary level of the lake. The loss of animals due to the same cause was very much greater and many of these perished subsequently of hunger as not a blade of grass was left...\r\nBalete, east side: Four drowned.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #2340)\r\n</p><p>Manila, Jan. 31.-Twenty persons, all natives, lost their lives in the tidal wave which followed the eruption of\r\nthe volcano Taal, according to press advices received here.

Half of the village of Lemery was destroyed. The reported sinking of the island on which the volcano is situated, a distance of from two to four feet, is confirmed by today&#39;s dispatches. Mud and ashes cover the surrounding country to a depth of six inches. An American school teacher has notified the Government officials here that all of the small villages on the western shoes of Lake Taal were overwhelmed by the tidal wave. He says that he believes the loss of life will not be less than three hundred, but this is not confirmed by others on the scene. (reference #3567)\r\n</p><p>Since the eruption was not sublacustrine, subaqueous explosions cannot be the cause of the tsunami, nor did the earthquakes of the initial phase generate tsunamis. Thus, as for the 1754 Plinian eruption, a pyroclastic flow mechanism is more likely (Delos Reyes et al. 2018). However, atmospheric shock waves generated by the strongest explosions (Pratt 1911) are another possible source mechanism of the tsunamis. Moore et al. (1966) also related the tsunamis observed during the 1965 eruption to shock waves, although the transfer of energy from air to water (or phase-coupling) operates mostly on large areas of deep water (Yokoyama 1987), i.e., larger and deeper than Taal Caldera Lake.

At the latitude of the earthquake of September 29, 2009, the Pacific plate moves westward with respect to the interior of the Australia plate at a velocity of about 86 mm/year. The earthquake occurred near the northern end of a 3,000 km long segment of the Pacific/Australia plate boundary that trends north-northeast; farther north of the earthquake&#39;s source region, the plate boundary trends northwest and then west. The eastern edge of the broad Australia plate may be viewed as a collection of small plates or microplates that move with respect to each other and with respect to the Pacific plate and the Australia plate interior.\r\n</p><p>On the basis of currently available location and fault mechanism information, we infer that the September 29 earthquake occurred as a normal fault rupture on or near the outer rise of the subducting Pacific plate.\r\n</p><p>The broad-scale Australia/Pacific plate boundary is one of the most active earthquake regions in the world. Earthquakes occur on the thrust-fault boundary between the Australia and Pacific plates, within the Pacific plate on both sides of the trench, and within and on the boundaries of the small plates that compose the eastern edge of the overall Australia plate.\r\n</p><p>(above from ref #1053)\r\n</p><p>Out of the 35 deaths in American Samoa (including 33 confirmed deaths &amp; 2 missing persons), 13 over the age of 60 and 3 under the age of 10.

(reference #9405)</p><p>The tsunami is believed responsible for much of the deaths and damage. The magnitude-8.8 quake - one of the strongest on record - and the tsunami that followed ravaged a 435-mile stretch of Chile&#39;s Pacific coast. In the coastal town of Constitucion, firefighters were looking for bodies of people swept away by the tsunami as they camped on Isla Orrego, an island in the mouth of the Maure River that flows through the city. Constitucion suffered perhaps the greatest loss of life in the disaster, in part because many people had come for carnival celebrations and were caught in huge waves that reached the central plaza. &#34;There were about 200 people in tents who disappeared&#34; on Isla Orrego, Fire Chief Miguel Reyes told The Associated Press. (ref. #6836)</p><p>Yet a large wave crashed later into the Chilean islands of Juan Fernandez, killing at least 8 people and leaving another 8 missing, the emergency office said. (ref. #6810)</p><p>While the Pacific basin was spared a major tsunami, there was major tsunami damage in Chile. In the coastal city of Talcahuano, where the surge reached nearly 5 m from peak to trough, a bizarre exchange took place: While even larger boats landed in the city centre, entire homes floated out to sea. &#39;The water swept aside everything that got in its way,&#39; said a resident of the small town of Boyecura. A wall of water swept across the Chilean island of Robinson Crusoe, 670 km off the coast, destroying many buildings and sweeping 5 people out to sea. Eleven others were missing. The Chilean Navy admitted it failed to give adequate tsunami warning to Robinson Crusoe, which lies in the Chilean archipelago of Juan Fernandez. (ref. #6811)</p><p>Islanders in the Chilean archipelago of Juan Fernandez felt a slight tremor early Saturday, one just like any other of those they hardly take notice of, and they slept on. Over the course of the morning, they saw on television the damage that the massive quake had caused in the city of Concepcion and elsewhere on the southern Chilean mainland. And then officials started waiting for information about a possible tsunami, but it ever came. Instead, as they saw the sea starting to rise, they rushed to switch on the sirens - but it was too late for some. The tsunami killed 5 people on the island, while 14 remained missing a day later, a toll that may have been avoided had the tsunami-detection and warning mechanisms been in order, some say. Upon hearing the sirens, some of the 629 residents of the village of Juan Bautista on Robinson Crusoe Is ran to the hills with no time for salvage. A wall of water - possibly nearly 5 metres high - ravaged everything in its way. Within a few minutes, the scene of the adventures of Scottish sailor Alexander Selkirk - marooned on the island from 1704 to 1708, and immortalized in Daniel Defoe&#39;s novel Robinson Crusoe - had been razed to the ground. &#34;Everything that had been along that three-km stretch just disappeared,&#34; said Fernando Avaria, the first pilot to fly over the area after the disaster. The cemetery, the churches, sports facilities and the area&#39;s only school were reduced to planks of wood and broken glass. The buildings of the local authority simply disappeared. &#34;It was devastating, really out of a horror film,&#34; said Margot Salas, a local who toured the area with Chilean state television cameras almost 24 hours after the disaster. As the sea receded, Robinson Crusoe Is faced a new flood - one of despair. Mud covered everything within 3 km of the coast. (ref. #6812)</p>",

On December 17 at about midday a great earthquake (40 deg 49 min N 14 deg 26 min E) occurred and a large crack on the flank facing the sea caused a huge flow; in the meantime the sea withdrew for three times and then inundated the beach furiously.

After the earthquake, the sea near Naples, Sorrento, Island of Nisida and on the Island of Ischia receded from the coast by 1,000 yards (according to other data, by 100 yards), ships ran aground; then, part of them were thrown out onto the dry land and left there far away from the coast, some ships were wrecked. The level of the water near the fortress walls in Civitavecchia decreased by three palms of the hand. (reference #2130)\r\n</p><p>The most significant of these tsunamis seems to be that occurred in December 1631 during the great Vesuvian eruption (16-18 December) that was observed in the entire Gulf of Naples from Ischia to Sorrento and that began with a remarkable water withdrawal of more than 1000 yards followed by waves invading the coasts deep inland[...] The tsunami is depicted in the chronicles by Braccini (1632) and Giuliani (1632) who gave reports rather consistent with each other as regards the event time, the water first receding and then invading the coast three times, the vessels damaged and the boats destroyed[...] The generation mechanism of the Vesuvian tsunamis is not easy to define. There is no obvious relationship between the eruption magnitude and the magnitude of the ensuing tsunami[...] The hypothesis of a tsunami induced by an earthquake associated with the eruptive phases is not convincing too, since there is no sound evidence that the 1631 was immediately preceded by a shock the size needed to generate a tsunami. Subaerial or submarine landslides can be excluded. (reference #3347)\r\n</p><p>The cause- effect relationship between eruptive phenomena and the tsunami is not clear. However, the retreat of the waters did not seem to be linked to the nuees ardentes entering the sea, because authors reported that the nuees ardentes overflow from the crater was strictly contemporaneous with sea withdrawal.

The most severe tremors were recorded in Lima, where, over a period of several days, many buildings were damaged beyond repair. Each tremor was accompanied by a rumbling sound. A man on a vessel near Callao reported\r\nthat he had had a distinct impression of the nearby mountains being raised and lowered, moved toward him and pushed farther back, almost as if by some elastic quality.\r\n<p>According to Hoff&#39;s catalogue (1840), a destructive earthquake occurred in Trujillo in the second half of the year. It is possible that Hoff&#39;s record refers to a town of the same name in Peru (Perrey, 1858). \r\n</p><p>[This may be difficult to verify. The more reliable sources (for example Silgado, 1968) do not mention destructive earthquakes in Lima between 1746 and 1828. Also, it is difficult to relate the above events to the tsunami of 1746, because in that disaster all vessels in the Callao area were lost.]\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #415)</p>",

        "comments": "An unusually high tidal wave was observed on the coast of the Kii Peninsula and at Ozuchi (Iwate Prefecture). There are no reports about an earthquake. Was this a tsunami of remote origin. (Reference #414, first published in Russian, 1974). Reference #150 lists the source of the tsunami that attacked Otsuchi as off Miyagi Prefecture.<p>\r\n</p><p>A Pacific tsunami flooded Japanese shores in January 1700. The waters drove villagers to high ground, damaged salt kilns and fishing shacks, drowned paddies and crops, ascended a castle moat, entered a government store house, washed away more than dozen buildings and spread flames that consumed twenty more. Return flows contributed to a nautical accident that sank tons of rice and killed two sailors. Samurai magistrates issued rice to afflicted villagers and requested lumber for those left homeless. A village headman received no advance warning from an earthquake; he wondered what to call the waves. (from p. 27 reference #2479)\r\n</p><p>Places flooded by the 1700 tsunami in Japan include Kuwagasaki, Tsugaruishi, Otsuchi, Miho and Tanabe. Some of the accounts mention damage in additional villages. In one account, the tsunami takes the form of rough seas that initiate a nautical accident near Nakaminato. (from p. 33 reference #2479)\r\n</p><p>A trans-Pacific reunion took place in 1996. Orphaned for nearly 300 years, the 1700 tsunami in Japan was reuinted, on the pages of a scientific journal, with an earthquake and tsunami in North America... The orphan dated the earthquake to the evening of January 26, 1700... and gave its approximate size as magnitude 9. (from p.93 reference #2479)\r\n</p><p>Today the 1700 tsunami is securely linked to a giant North American earthquake. The tie was strengthened in 1997 by tree-ring dating that narrowed the time window for a great Cascadia earthquake to the months between August 1699 and May 1700. The earthquake&#39;s enormity was confirmed in 2003 through improved estimates of the tsunami&#39;s size and from computer simulations of Cascadia earthquakes and of the tsunami itself... The tsunami&#39;s written record in Japan has become clearer too, with discovery in 1998 of the Miho headman&#39;s account, authentification in 2002 of the Nakaminato shipwreck certificate and explanation in 2004 of a discordant date from Tsugaruishi. (from p. 93 reference #2479)\r\n</p><p>The Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ) is situated off of the Pacific Northwest coast of North America, from Northern California to Vancouver Island, British Columbia. (from reference #2480)\r\n</p><p>If the 1700 tsunami came from Cascadia, we can estimate the origin time and magnitude of the earthquake. The earliest documented tsunami arrival time was around midnight on 27 January Japan time, or around 15:00 on 27 January GMT. Because tsunami travel time from Cascadia to Japan is about 10 hours, the earthquake origin time is estimated at around 5:00 27 January GMT or 21:00 on 26 January local time in Cascadia. This time is consistent with Native American legends that an earthquake occurred on a winter night. (reference #2654)</p>",

The power of the tsunami was enough to wrench the house off its foundations, partially caved in two external walls, and rip off the deck and deposit it on the beach. The damage wasn&#39;t just caused by water, tree trunks and other debris were carried in the tsunami which reached 4.1 metres above mean sea level and traveled 140 metres up the river creek next to the cottage.(reference #11666)\r\nThe team surveyed the areas on December 9 - three-and-a-half weeks after the magnitude-7.8 Kaikoura earthquake, which struck just after midnight on November 14 wreaking massive landscape changes to North Canterbury and Marlborough. Findings were based on marine debris, such as logs, kelp, fish, crayfish and paua found well above where they would normally be expected. The tsunami was found to be highest at Goose Bay, with data indicating a maximum runup height above tide level at the time of the tsunami of 6.9m &#43; or - 0.3m.

In Laucala Bay waters the amplitude, measured from crest to trough, may have been about 0.5 m (i.e. the order of half the tidal range) because sand banks appeared and disappeared and the change in level on the barrier reef was sufficient to have a noticeable effect on appearance of the ocean waves breaking on the reef edge, according to reliable observers at the MRD office which is about 2 km from Laucala Bay shoreline and 8 km from the reef bounding the seaward side of the bay (Fig. 3). Unfortunately the only available tide-gauge data in Suva are smoothed 15-minute mean plots and mean hourly values of the Suva Harbour sea level. These data &#39;effectively smooth out the tsunami waves and a tsunami in Suva Harbour could not be detected. The occurrence of the waves is of particular interest because earthquakes with such a small magnitude do not generally cause tsunamis (Iida, 1970). The tsunami was probably generated by a minor submarine slump caused by the shaking (intensity MM 4-5) in the Suva-Beqa outer reef zone in a manner similar to that of the 1953 tsunami (Everingham, 1983b), which illustrates .the ease with which a slump can be initiated. If slumping can be started by relatively low earthquake intensities even a minor shallow tremor in the southeastern Viti Levu seismic zone (Fig. 4) could start a submarine slump should the epicentre be close to a suitable source.

        "comments": "2013, June 2. Tsunami-like waves were observed along the US east coast during the afternoon of June 13, 2013 (day 164). The source is complex and still under review, though the coincidence at several gages with strong atmospheric pressure fluctuations indicate that it is at least partly generated by meteorological causes. The event occurred in close conjunction with a weather system labeled by the National Weather Service as a low-end derecho which propagated from west to east over the New Jersey shore just before the tsunami. It is also possible that the slumping at the continental shelf east of New Jersey played a role. The tsunami was observed at over 30 tide gages and one DART buoy throughout the Northwestern Atlantic Ocean.\r\n<p>A first-hand description was provided by Brian Coen who observed the event at Barnegat Inlet in New Jersey:\r\nAround 3:30pm on Thursday June 13, 2013, Brian Coen was spear fishing near the mouth of Barnegat Inlet; just south of the submerged northern breakwater. Earlier in the day around noon, thunderstorms had moved through the area. By 3:30pm the weather was overcast with a light east wind. At approximately 3:30, the outgoing tide was amplified by strong currents which carried divers over the submerged breakwater (normally 3-4 feet deep). This strong outrush continued for 1-2 minutes and eventually the rocks in the submerged breakwater were exposed. Brian backed his boat out before being sucked over as well.\r\n</p><p>At this point, Brian noticed a large wave coming in, approximately 6 feet peak-to-trough and spanning across the inlet. The upper 2 feet of the wave was breaking. This wave occurred in conjunction with a reversal of the current such that even though the tide was going out, a strong surge was entering the inlet. This surge carried the divers back over the submerged reef and into the inlet from where they were picked up. On the south jetty three people were swept off the rocks which were 5 to 6 feet above sea level at the time. At least two were injured requiring medical treatment. There was no more strong activity after about 5 minutes.\r\n</p><p> (above from reference #10663)\r\n</p><p>On June 13, 2013, a widespread meteotsunami was recorded along the central Atlantic state coasts (Lipa et al. 2013). This event, which was well recorded from Maryland up to Massachusetts, caused two injuries in New Jersey where it reached its maximum size and was recorded across the Atlantic in Puerto Rico and Bermuda. (reference #11036)\r\n</p><p>An unusual storm system moved eastward across the country on June 13, 2013, commonly called a &#34;derecho&#34;, and appears to have launched a meteotsunami that impacted the US East Coast.

The landslide spread out about 60 m into the lake in deep water. There was little warning, and one person was killed and others were injured by falling debris.  As the hill continued to slide, people left the village... As the large landslide March 20 1910 that fell from 300 m cliffs into Lake Taupo destroying Little Waihi village in its path, entered the lake, it caused a 3 m high surge. The surge then swept to the &#34;opposite&#34; shore where some children, swept off their feet, were rescued with some difficulty by adults. Canoes and boats were washed away. The height of the surge on the opposite shore and its location are unknown, possibly as far away as Motutere, possibly more local to the village, noting that the shoreline of the lake may have changed since 1910. The height of the surge needs to be at least 0.5 metre to have caused the children problems, but probably no more than 1-1.5 m, otherwise there would have been greater impact.  (reference #5324)"

        "comments": "On the night of 2-3 February 1936, a wave or waves occurred at Goose Bay, damaging one hut and smashing another, as well as damaging a parked car and depositing huge rocks well above HWM. The wave/s, which passed nearby to another cottage in which two people were sleeping, did not awaken them. The damage was attributed to one wave only probably occurring at high tide (which was just after midnight) or thereabouts, although the reason for assuming this was not recorded. \r\nThe waves occurred during one of the most damaging storms to strike New Zealand in the 20th century (Brenstrum, 1997) and at the same time as high spring tides at Kaikoura, which, according to NIWA Tide Forecaster, (http://www.niwa.co.nz/services/free/tides) are estimated to have been 0.07 m above MHWS. The storm crossed the North Island on 2 February, primarily affecting the North Island, but strong effects were also experienced on the northeast coast of the South Island. Hence, the conditions were conducive to the occurrence of storm surge, and storm waves. However, storm surge and storm waves alone would not be limited to a few waves and would affect a greater length of coastline over a longer time. As to why the damage at Goose Bay was attributed to one wave only rather than a series of storm waves is not known, but the strong pressure gradients associated with the storm may also have provided the right conditions for the occurrence of a few rogue waves or a meteo-tsunami, in which a short sequence of waves is possible. \r\nAnother explanation of the limited effect possibly lies in the occurrence of an offshore landslide. Just a few hundred metres offshore from Goose Bay is a submarine canyon, the extensive accumulated sediments at the top of which are considered capable of sliding into the canyon causing a large local tsunami at Goose Bay in particular (Walters et al. 2006). However, the coincidence of the inundation with severe weather conditions and high spring tide levels is too great to dismiss, and the inundation is attributed here to a meteo-tsunami or extreme storm waves and storm surge.

We can only suggest that not only the seismotectonic movements of the sea-bottom contributed considerably to the generation of tsunami, but also the landslides of loose bottom sediments moved by the earthquakes. Other mechanisms may also have contributed. (reference #2130)"

On the next day, from noon to about 16:00, the surf in the bay was stronger than usual and was even so heavy that a sloop launched from the steamship could not approach the moorage, and returned to the steamship. Weak movements of the water were observed at Bandaneira from 22:00 on the 20th to 2:00 on the 21st. The movements were very noticeable all around Lonthor Island, especially at Lonthor itself. The tidal waves surged onto the coast at Lonthor, but did not go beyond the usual flood tide marks and did not do any harm. (reference #414)"

The tide, at that time, was above half ebbed, and retired as far as the head of the key, leaving the vessels, within the pier, on dry ground: when on a sudden the sea came on with a great run, filling the quay to the height of six feet perpendicular; and the water remained at the same height near half an hour, but was all the time agitated as in a storm. By this means all the vessels were afloat; some broke loose from their moorings, and on the recess of the waters were likely to be carried out to sea. The consternation, which this occasioned, gave no leisure for accurate observation, nor could anyone inform me of the exact distance from the time of the first swell till the waters rose to the height of six feet, some speaking of four, others of five or six minutes. It is to be observed that the like phaenomenon happened on the 1st of November last, and the waters then rose to the same perpendicular height.&#34;"

Other boats had minor damages. From the eye-witness description: &#34;I heard a strange sound. At first, I thought it was a helicopter, but then I realized that the sound came out of the fjord. There rose a cloud of smoke from the sea, and a huge wave came towards the land. There were several boats in the harbor with people in one of them, who were terrified. The sea in the harbor started to bubble and fizz.

There was a multiple eruption of the Miyejin submarine volcano (31 deg 56.7 min N., 140 deg 0.5 min E.) 130 km south of Hachijo Island. The augite-hypersthene-dacite composition of the lavas determined the explosive nature of the eruptions. All the explosions were well recorded by the hydrophones of the American SOFAR system, including those on the coast of California. Some of the eruptions were observed visually from ships and airplanes by Japanese specialists. Thus, during the weak eruption of September 23 at 13h 40m, a water dome, with protuberances 600-800 m high and 2 km in diameter, arose over the volcano. No seaquake was felt, but waves 50 m long and 2 m high spread over the sea surface. During the stronger eruptions weak tsunamis were generated, 52 of which were registered by the tide gauge on Hachijo Island. The strongest of these waves were also registered by tide gauges on Jogashima Island and Cape\r\nOmae on the south coast of Japan. The travel time of the waves to Hachijo Island was about 30 minutes, the period 1.5 minutes, the height 10-90 cm. In the nature of dispersion and other parameters, the waves corresponded to theoretical Cauchy-Poisson waves from an initial impulse with a source diameter of 2 <u>&#43;</u> km. Some waves were like pulses. This was apparently due to the interference of waves bending around both sides of Aoga-shima Island, midway between the volcano and Hachijo Island. \r\n<p>The tsunami of September 26 was recorded in Hilo, in the Hawailan Islands with an amplitude of less than 0.1 m. \r\n</p><p>The ship &#34;Kiyo Maru No 5&#34; of the Japanese hydrographic service, which had come out to study the eruption, was lost in the eruption of September 24.</p>",

Resulting downslope movement of a large volume of sediment in the vicinity of the Kitimat delta caused substantial demage to nearby dock facilities and coastal settlements.\r\n<p>On January 1975, construction was completed on a 7.5 m-high rock fill crib wharf built outward from the beach at Moon Bay. On April 1975, construction of a rock fill and dredged sand breakwater was initiated using coarse dredge material excavated from the bottom within and slightly seaward of the tidal zone. On the morning of April 27, 1975, the breakwater and crib wharf were seen to move seaward, being carried by the initial movement of the sediment slide, approximately 53 minutes after extreme low\r\ntide (6.02 m drawdown from high tide). On April 27, 1975, following a major slide, water waves with ranged up to 8.2 m were generated...\r\n</p><p>The slump originated across a front approximately 1 km wide and travelled approximately 5 km down the inlet to a final water depth of 210 m. The main part of this path was over ~ 1/2 deg slopes. The associated water wave amplitude, possible as large as 8 m and water disturbance for about 1 hour was responsible for the destruction of boats, docks and other property.\r\n</p><p>At the time of occurrence of the slide of April 27At the time of occurrence of the slide of April 27, 1975, there was no mujor seismic event reported in that area. Also, there was no meteorological event at that time which could have caused large water level oscillations. Hence, there is no doubt that the water waves were generated by the submarine slide. At least two water waves (and possibly three) were generated, and propagated into the connecting bays and channels, The largest wave was estimated to be 8.2 m in range (crest to through)... The whole water-level disturbance lasted about an hour. In Bish Creek and Clio Bay, which are about 8 km from the site of the slide, at least one wave was observed.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #4153)</p>"

Old Indians told him the slide was an overhang, and the fall buried hundreds who were clamming there. The wave washed over to Hat Island and drowned hundreds who ere clamming there. \r\n</p><p>...it is pointed out that the naming of known recent historical persons of one&#39;s own family gives a historical basis that cannot lightly be dismissed. The story would indicate a date of 1820-1830 for the incident.\r\n</p><p>The numbers given by John Brown could be exaggerations, but it is certain that the clam beds at Camano Head and the northern end of Hat Island always have been the most important beds in the Snohomish area. Hence, being early on summer morning before the people were all up, the casualties may indeed have been very heavy, even running into hundreds, especially at the Head itself from which there was no escape.\r\n</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #11939:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>The accounts also mention that some flooding may have occurred at Hibolb (a larger village on the northern Everett shoreline near the mouth of the Snohomish), but if damage occurred at all, it was limited. No mention is made of the wave at other low-lying sites in the vicinity, such as Sandy Point on Whidbey Island - the closest barrier beach and marsh to Camano Head.\r\n</p><p>Although the accounts leave many questions unanswered, the following seems fairly clear. Early on a summer morning in the early 1800s, a large landslide occurred at Camano Head, carrying standing trees to the beach, and burying many people living at the toe of the bluff. The landslide sounded like thunder and created large volumes of dust. The landslide also resulted in a tsunami that traveled south toward Hat Island, washing over the barrier beach, destroying houses or encampments and drowning many people.\r\n</p><p>The accounts make no mention of ground shaking, suggesting that the landslide was not associated with a major earthquake.\r\n</p><p>The Camano Head landslide is the only known example of a landslide on Puget Sound generating a tsunami large enough to cause significant loss of life.\r\n</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #11942:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>One of the Snohomish villages was located beneath a bluff at the southern tip of Camano Island, Camano Head.

One early summer day, just as first dawn was beginning to lighten the eastern sky, that village was destroyed. </p><p>A sound like thunder awakened the families living in the village across the water on the northwestern shore of Hat Island -- perhaps also the people at Hebolb, the major village in north Everett.

Marigram records displayed unusual markings, first thought of as the possible result of a submarine disturbance. The water rose more than a foot, fell, and then fluctuated. Present knowledge has us regard the disturbance as atmospheric rather than submarine, and to assume that the water simply responded to the sudden and violent change in air pressure. There was a large storm in the vicinity of Washington and British Columbia, which weather observers believe spawned this pulse. Apparently, atmospheric gravity waves can be set up meteorologically and travel considerable distances from their source (Reference #237).\r\n<p>The tide gauge at San Francisco registered waves of the tsuunami type of meteorological origin, hypothetically caused by a rapid drop in pressure of 2 mm (0.1 inches) from 4:00 to 5:00 (local time, 12:00-13:00 UTC) and a rapid rise by the same amount from 5:00 to 6:00 (local time, 13:00-14:00 UTC) (Reference #415).</p>"

This tidal wave hit the islands during the same night the steampship was damaged and caused exntensive losses there too (according to the Record of Unusual events at Sea, compiled by an English Steamship Company, and reproduced by the Nautical Branch of the Meteorological Service of England). (reference #415)\r\n<p>On 19 July 1924 starting at about 19:15 NZMT (possibly Chatham island time CIT (18:30 NZMT)), a series of waves variously said to be 3-6 m high or reaching up to 6 m above HWM, locally called a tidal wave, affected a number of locations on the Chatham Islands over a period of just over three hours. Those locations most affected were the settlements of Wharekauri, Kaingaroa and Owenga on north and eastern side of Chatham Island, and the settlement on Pitt Island. At Kaingaroa, the waves swept over 100 m inland, sweeping away a dam supplying fresh water, one trawler was smashed and another lost. Near Wharekauri, a bridge was badly damaged, fences washed away, and the water washed over Te Awanui island. Several boats were damaged at Owenga, a small hut was washed away and some machinery at the shell-crushing plant damaged. On Pitt Island, the wharf disappeared, two small boats swept up a stream, and beaches eroded of shells. Mangere Island was also affected and a large landslide occurred. There were no deaths or injuries, although one person was washed from his horse near Owenga, and deaths may have been prevented by people at Kaingaroa and Owenga hearing the roaring approach of the first wave and running inland. According to contemporary reports locations on the west coast were not affected. However, recollections written some 70 years later (Holmes, 1993; see transcriptions), which accurately record effects at Wharekauri, also record higher than expected water levels in the creek at Waitangi during the time locations on the east side of the island were affected. However, the account incorrectly attributes the source to South America. \r\nSeveral accounts also relate the near-capsizing of the ship Tees en route to the Chatham Islands from Christchurch to the tsunami on the Chathams. However the damage to the Tees occurred two days after the tsunami, and was storm related. \r\nTide charts for Lyttelton on July 19 (held at National Archives, Christchurch) have been checked, but no disturbance is visible on the poor quality records.\r\nThe newspaper and other reports of this event give a very credible account of a tsunami affecting the Chatham Islands only. The sea level disturbances had a sudden onset with the arrival of the first wave heralded by roaring, effects over eastern and western coasts of the islands within a short time, the occurrence of a series of large waves followed by smaller waves and duration of several hours. The occurrence of a storm is not mentioned, and while the tide was high at the start of the waves and it was a spring tide (both of which are about correct, HW at 1920 CIT, acc. to NIWA Tide Forecaster (www.niwa.co.nz/services/free/tides)), a recollection (Holmes, 1993; see transcriptions) specifically states that the high level at Waitangi, 2 hours after high tide, was odd as the weather was fine at the time.

At first, \u0091it was theorized by some that construction activity in the harbor caused the initial landslide. However, this paper presents the findings of an in-depth scientific investigation that concludes that such a theory is impossible. The findings paint a clear picture of the failure of the submerged Skagway River delta that was overloaded by flood sediments and exacerbated by river diking. Slide volumes estimated at over 20,000,000 cubic yards that consisted of a massive initial slide and subsequent retrogressive earth slides produced the tsunami that caused the fatality and destroyed or damaged harbor structures. \r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #1315:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>A negative tide of 1.2 m at 7:10 pm local time was the probable cause of a submarine landslide-generated tsunami that caused about $25 million damage and one fatality in Skagway Harbor, Alaska.

After a period of extraordinary activity of the volcano of Stromboli which started in Feb, its powerful explosion occurred with a noise of unprecedented intensity and with the discharge of enormous puffs of black smoke that enveloped the entire island for a short time. Anyone trying to move was knocked down. The explosion was accompanied by water being blown up from the sea and flooding the coast, everything around was overturned, and all the ships were carried approximately 300m up to vineyards adjacent to the coast. The tsunami waves were generated (evidently, owing to a sudden increase of the atmospheric pressure). &#34;The displacement of water, like during a weak tsunami, was observed on the Island of Ustica. First, a whirlpool appeared in the sea in the Piccolo Lagoon of the Island of Capri, i.e. in the part of the island facing the Island of Stromboli, and reefs usually covered with water were uncovered for 1 m, and then, 6-7 s later, powerful waves gushed over the normal water line. Oscillations of the sea level of a very low amplitude (0.5 cm) with a period of about 11 min were recorded by the tide gauge stalled at the lighthouse [Faro] near Messina after l8h and lasted 90 min; they resumed half an hour later and lasted 30 min more. The tide gauge in Messina recorded usual sea waves with a period of 7-8 min, but of a low amplitude - about 1 cm, 2 cm maximum - during the eruption. Oscillations of a much higher amplitude started approximately at 18h, and the amplitude reached 7.5 cm 20min later; after that, the waves caused by the eruption started to subside, but continued about 3 hours more. No signs of tsunami in the records of the tide gauges in the towns of Palermo, Catania, Cagliari (Sardinia Is), Naples, on the Island of Ischia, in the town of Civitavecchia were revealed.

It was supposedly observed by two ships, the Pretty Jane and the SS Go Ahead, which were respectively off East Cape and Waipiro Bay (historically known as Open Bay). However, it is probable that some confusion has occurred with the names of the ships, and they were in fact the same ship.\r\nThe disturbance, which was less than 400 m across, was visible in front of the ship and to seaward and was moving towards the ship faster than it could steam.  The main disturbance was successfully avoided. Nevertheless the ship was tossed and pitched about until it reached smooth water. \r\nNewspaper accounts note that a slight earthquake was felt in Gisborne about 12-24 hours previously. Gregg (1958), in analysing the reports, suggests the disturbance was &#34;a tsunami resulting from submarine landslides or faulting connected with the earthquake felt at Gisborne&#34;. There are no accounts of a tsunami reaching the coast in newspapers of the day. While earthquake faulting could cause such a disturbance, the earthquake&#39;s occurrence is too early and almost certainly too small, although it may have acted as a trigger. A more plausible explanation is a small submarine landslide, or an expulsive gas emission.\r\nThe event is given a validity of 2, as it is possible that a small tsunami was generated, but the source was too small and too localised for the tsunami to reach land at an observable height. The event is primarily recorded in the database to document the occurrence of localised disturbances at sea which may have been caused by gas hydrate emission, the larger events of this sort having been identified as possible tsunami generators.

The lack of any tectonic movement implies that this seiche probably was a storm surge. On the basis of this evidence earlier Aegean seawaves not correlated with tectonic movements may also be interpreted as storm surges. This includes the sea-waves observed on 23-25 April 1928, 23 February 1959 and 6 June 1961.(reference #2753)</p>"

There was a powerful eruption of the Awu Volcano on Sangihe Island, which generated, so far as can be judged from the fragmentary data, joint gravitational oscillations of the atmosphere and the hydrosphere of the same type as the waves from the Krakatau explosion and corresponding oscillations in level [seiche type?] in the internal seas in Indonesia.</p><p>The eruption began at 18:10 without any preliminary phenomena. A huge column of smoke rose over the volcano. Lightning flashed. It rained with a mixture of ashes. This soon became a real ash and rock fall.\r\n</p><p>The explosion of the volcano was not accompanied by noticeable tremors of the island. The eruption reached extraordinary power at about 21:00. After this, the fall of pumice stopped, and the ashfall also diminished by midnight. Soon after the eruption, boiling mud flows saturated with hydrogen sulfide, presumably formed as a result of the emptying of the crater lake, rushed along the crevices which furrowed the slopes of the volcano. As a result of the eruption, <b>1,532 people died</b> on the island, or 2% of its population, since many huts collapsed under the weight of ejecta, while others were washed away by the streams. The northern part of the island suffered considerably more than the southern. Gardens, kitchen-gardens, and coconut plantations were buried.</p><p>The loud noises of the explosions of the volcano were heard on\r\nTernate Island from 18:00 to 22:00 and then at night until 2:00. At Manado, several explosions were heard for half an hour after 18:30, and flames flickered on the horizon to the north. At Tolitoli and Donggala, and also at many parts in the southern and eastern regions of Sulawesi Is. and on Kabia Island, including Makassar and Maros and on Timor\r\nIsland, at 19:30 and later, very faint muffled booms were heard, like distant artillery fire. Similar sounds were heard at 20:30 at Ambon and at night on Flores Is., at Larantuka.</p><p>The sound wave was followed by a gravitation wave, which caused perceptible tremors at a number of places. Prolonged faint trembling of the ground was felt in the evening on Ternate Is. At Makassar at 1:57, tremors 3-4 degrees in strength were registered. Similar oscillations were registered at Maros and in general in the southern and eastern regions of Sulawesi Is. and on Kabia Is. At Bima, on Sumbawa Is., very strong horizontal oscillations were felt from 2:05 to 2:15, and very weak [ground] waves were felt at 5:10 and at 8:10. Several huts collapsed on Flores Is. at Reo. At Maumere, horizontal oscillations lasting 2 minutes were felt at 2:30; one hut collapsed. At Ende, strong oscillations were felt at 1:00. At Larantuka, horizontal tremors lasting 2 minutes were felt at 2:30; one residence collapsed.</p><p>At Surabaja at 1:34, the pendulum of the astronomical clock stopped.</p><p>At Djakarta (Batavia), the magnetograph registered an earthquake at 1:17 and then at 1:21 and 6:00.</p><p>Oscillations in sea level were noticed at Bonthain, Bulukumba and Salajar; the only consequence was minor damage to one boat in the Tanga River at Bonthain.</p><p>At Bima, oscillations in level were noticeable at 3:00. The water rose high at the entrance to the bay; this was accompanied by a loud noise, which was even heard in the home of the local superintendent, a 2-hour walk away. This rustling lasted 20 minutes, after which the water began to rise very quickly. The highest rise of water was observed at 5:00, when there should have been an ebb.</p><p>A weak tsunami was observed at 7:00 in Ambon Bay. In a few minutes, the water level oscillated from the highest to the lowest level, with a range of more than 1.5 m.\r\n</p><p>The ashes ejected during the explosion settled on a considerable area to the south of Sangihe Is. A ship traveling to Sangihe Is. from Ternate Is. was covered with ashes; ashes fell on Likupang. At Donggala and Makassar, much ash fell on the 8th from 3:00 until sunset.</p>",

The estimated wave surge height resulting from the 19 May event reached 4-10 m, particularly around the S part of the island. Rockfalls continued to produce plumes that could be seen from a distance.

Submarine landslide may have initiated the disturbance, and this possibility\r\nis investigated.

The water inundated the lower sections of the town and reached the center of the main square.

In Pisco the sea receded for a distance of 8 km (2 leagues), or, according to other information, for 2 km. The terrified inhabitants fled to the mountains, but some of the brave ones returned to see what was happening on the shore. While they were there, the sea level rose quickly and advanced &#34;in a frenzy&#34; without giving the observers a chance to escape, and thus they perished. The town was inundated and the sea advanced inland. Where the town once was, is now a bay in which ships lie at anchor. The town was rebuilt 1 km from the ocean shore. According to other reports, all houses in the town were washed away, but the more solidly constructed fortifications stood up. In Canete and Chincha, a similar inundation destroyed the warehouses in which 140 tons of mercury were stored and awaiting shipment to Acapulco. Chorrilos and Chancay were also inundated. </p><p>In Callao, the sea receded 2 km from shore, or, according to other data, far enough that the water was hardly visible. After some time the sea level rose, rushing in like a mountain of water, submerging the port and city of Callao and tossing vessels 4 km inland.

In Pisco, the ocean receded to a point 2 km from the shore, only to rise with such force that the water advanced almost 2 km beyond its usual high mark.

The place set apart for women in the church of Evagelistria collapsed.\r\nMany parts of Saint Minas, the tower bell of Sotiros and the wall of Saint Paraskeve were fissured. Large damage occurred in the capital Amaxike. As it results from a memorial tablet in the wall of the Latin church Pantokrator, which was located in the fortress of Leukada and was built by Varbarigo Balbo in 1733, this church was pulled down by the earthquake. In the same note of Kontarini, it is written that at 2h in the night an earthquake occurred and it was near to destroy all houses in Lixuri. The sea rushed in the land and then withdrew. It caused damage in the northern and western part of Cephallonia, mainly in Palike, in Erisos, and in Argostoli. In Zante and Arta the earthquake was felt as very violent and as violent in Patra.

The source of the earthquake apparently lay off Acapulco and San Marcos.\r\n<p>A tsunami arose. At Acapulco, the sea retreated to the middle of the bay, exposing the reefs. Alternate quiet flood and ebb tides were observed with some pauses in the movement of water on reaching the highest and lowest levels. Two hours later, the flood tide was so large, that the water reached the doors of the church situated in the highest part of the city square. The square was flooded. The ocean advanced inland like a wall and with great speed, sweeping away everything in its path. Then, in a strong ebb tide, stronger than in 1787 [?], the greater part of the bottom of the bay was laid bare. After this, the sea level began gradually to return to its normal state. After the tsunami, the breakwater was totally covered with sand for 1 1/2-2 m (5-6 feet), while the beach had expanded by 17 m (20 vara).\r\n</p><p>There is also an account by the master of Acapulco port. &#34;Yesterday at 14:00, a strong earthquake occurred in the port. It lasted 5 minutes; it recurred in the next quarter of an hour, and was followed by other shocks, not so prolonged. All this terrified and depressed the\r\ninhabitants .... After the horrors of the earthquake, there began movements of the sea in the form of an unusual flood and ebb tide, the first (along the horizontal) from 40 to 50 m (from 60 to 60 vara), and the second approximately\r\nfrom 15 to 20 m (from 20 t o 25 vara). One of the two ships, which was taking on provisions in the harbor, was forced to retreat out to the bay for safety&#34;.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #415)</p>",

The violence decreased for a moment and then there followed a terrible shaking and at the same time an east-west oscillation of such force that the pendulum mounted to 43<sup>o</sup>; the duration of this terrible earthquake being precisely one minute.

        "comments": "January 23, 1855 after 21:00 [local time] there was an earthquake in Wellington and vicinity, lasting for 1.5 min. In Wellington, the ship Pandora was anchored in 11 m of water. According to the captain, the shocks that were generated during the earthquake, which lasted over a minute, felt as if the ship was hitting rough bottom. Disembarking with his mate onto the beach, the captain became aware of a rapid succession of ebbs and flows. The waves were observed for at least 50 minutes, as they rolled over the shore of South Island. A &#34;terrible&#34; tidal wave rushed onto the shore. (reference #415) <p>The 1855 January 23 0932 UT 2111 Local time MW8.2-8.4 Wairarapa earthquake generated New Zealand&#39;s largest historical locally-generated tsunami. The tsunami most affected the Cook Strait region, where the Wairarapa Fault and subsidiary faults (Wharekauhau Thrust and small play fault) ruptured beneath Cook Strait causing significant uplift (up to 6.4 m) of a large region west of the fault on the northern side of the strait and a small amount of subsidence on the southern side. The effects of the tsunami were observed at least as far north as Waikawa Beach, where fish were deposited above high water mark, and as far south as the Clarence River mouth and possibly Kaikoura, although evidence for the latter is equivocal. A bore in the Avon River attributed by De Lange &amp; Healy (1986) to tsunami and the &#34;great sea wave&#34; in Otago harbour (Davie, 1870) were almost certainly seismically induced seiches, not tsunami. Seiches, often confused with tsunami on the coast, were observed in coastal rivers and estuaries at Wairoa (Hawke&#39;s Bay), Motupipi in Golden Bay, Kaiapoi and at Lyttelton, as well as in many inland water bodies. The greatest known height (10-11 m) reached by the tsunami was at Te Kopi in Palliser Bay, where a shed on a cliff 9 m above the sea was swept away. Here also, on the night of the earthquake and tsunami, a sailor who had experienced a tsunami in South America, persuaded a family to leave the shore. Nearby, at Whangaimoana, a tool that had been on the shore at the time of the earthquake was found many years later in a location 10 m above high water mark. High waves were also observed along the coast south of Wellington and along the Wairau Bar on the southern shore of Cook Strait, probably reaching 6-7 m near Rarangi. In Lyall Bay the tsunami swept about 2-2.5 km inland, inundating what is now the suburb of Miramar. The sea sweeping in from Lyall Bay (est. height above sea level at time, 4-5 m) reportedly met the water sweeping in from Evans Bay, on the Wellington Harbour side of Rongotai Isthmus (est. height above sea level at time 3-4 m). Within Wellington Harbour, water levels varied considerably. At Petone and along the road to the Hutt Valley, fish were deposited (the tide was high at the time of the earthquake) but the water levels do not seem to have reached much more than a metre or so above normal. However, the shops along the beach front at Lambton Quay (now on reclaimed land 200 m from the shore) were inundated with waves about 1.4-2.4 m above sea level at the time immediately after or during the earthquake. Barnett et al. (1991) (Grapes &amp; Downes (1997)) separated the source of the tsunami within the harbour into three different components: the horizontal movement, causing an immediate &#34;slosh&#34;; differential vertical movement across the harbour; and the much greater deformation in Cook Strait and extending across the whole region west of the fault. For a local source tsunami, the duration seems to have been quite long, observations consistently indicating that in Wellington harbour and in Cook Strait water levels oscillated for 8-12 hours. It was also said that the tides were irregular for a week (see entries for January 24-31, January 24 and February 3). (reference #5324)</p>",

Two great earthquakes at Arica, Peru (now Chile) on Aug 13 21:30 UTC and Aug 14 01:30 UTC with magnitudes up to 8.5, generated catastrophic tsunamis that affected the entire Pacific rim and lasted 2-3 days. 21 m waves were generated locally. In South America, more than <b>25,000 people were killed from the earthquake and tsunami</b> and several settlements along the Peru-Chile coast were destroyed. \r\n</p><p>The tsunami which followed the earthquake affected the coast of Peru and Chile, at least from Trujillo (where there was damage) to Chiloe Island. The belt most affected by the tsunami extended approximately from Chala and Islai to Iquique; it is possible that the mean rise of water exceeded 10 m here. The oscillations in level apparently began with the flood tide, but at most places, especially those remote from the source, the subsequent stronger ebb was noticed first. The tsunami did the greatest material damage at Arica.\r\n</p><p>The Arica tsunami affected practically the entire Pacific rim and lasted at least 2-3 days. It was registered by six tide gauges: at Sydney, on Kodiak Island, at Astoria, San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego. However, one cannot confidently pin-point the onset of the tsunami even on the tide gauge records, and for this reason, the published data on the travel time of the tsunami are unreliable.\r\n</p><p><b>NOTE:</b> All of the associated runup locations are listed with the first event. The earthquake was accompanied by an enormous number of recurrent shocks. \r\n</p><p>Waves from the first event (Aug 13 21:30 UTC) arrived at the Hawaiian Islands about 1:00 a.m. local time and from the second at 5:00 a.m. Aug 14.</p><p>Waves from the first event (Aug 13 21:30 UTC) arrived at San Diego about 2:00 a.m. local time Aug 14.

        "comments": "A magnitude 8.3 earthquake in Chile produced a 24 m tsunami that caused extensive damage along the Peru-Chile coast and fatalities in Chile. Tsunami waves occurred on a large stretch of the South American coast. At the source of the earthquake and the tsunami, the mean rise of water was 10 m. The oscillations in level apparently began here with a\r\nsmall ebb tide. It was observed throughout the Pacific Basin including Samoa, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, Mexico and California. The tsunami was observed at all the islands of the Hawaiian archipelago. The tsunami caused fatalities in Hawaii and Japan. It was well recorded at Fort Point and Sausalito with amplitudes of about 0.6 feet but not seen on the San Diego tide gauge. According to References #415 and #3977 thousands were swept away in Fiji.\r\n<p>May 9, 20:00, 1877, 21.5 S, 70.5 W, magnitude 8. There was a destructive earthquake and catastrophic tsunami with source off the northern coast of Chile. This is sometimes mentioned in the literature as the Iquique tsunami. At Iquique at 20:20, a slight booming rumble was heard, accompanied by slow oscillations of the ground, which soon became terrible tremors lasting about 4 minutes. It was impossible to stand without holding on to something. A cloud of dust arose in the air. A fire was\r\nstarted by overturned lamps in the southern part of the city. However, it was soon extinguished. This earthquake was considered stronger than any previously felt in the city [7 degrees]. There was a similar earthquake at San Pedro, accompanied by a terrible rumble. Buildings were partially destroyed, and many inhabitants were confused, but no one died, since people had time to run from their homes [7-8 degrees]. Tarapaca, Mamina, Pica, La Horia, La Tarama, Conchones, and Punta Lobos were more or less destroyed [7]. At Caleta Pabellon de Pica, the earthquake lasted 5 minutes with increasing force. More than 10 fires were started by overturned lamps. The fires were extinguished by the flood. <b>Thirty-three workers died in a\r\nlandslide</b>. Furniture and lamps were overturned; fires broke out. Colossal chunks of rock fell from the mountain sides; cracks up to 15 m deep in places opened up in the ground. According to reports, <b>30 workers were buried</b> in a guano pit. A slight shock was felt here three or four days before the earthquake. The guano grooves caved in at Huanillos. All homes were destroyed. Tocopilla was destroyed. <b>Forty miners (according to later reports, only three or four) died</b> when a shaft collapsed 8 km south of the city. At Cobija, almost all adobe houses were damaged or destroyed. People were thrown to the ground [7-81. The earthquake lasted 3-8 minutes; all the furnaces collapsed at Caracoles. At Mejillones, a very severe earthquake lasted 7 minutes; people were thrown to the ground. (reference #415)\r\n</p><p>Most of the damage and loss of life was caused by the tsunami. There were about 30 dead in Iquique, 14 in\r\nCobija, etc. In Arica the population withdrew to high ground immediately, thus avoiding casualties. (reference #252)</p>",

        "comments": "This magnitude 8 earthquake was the largest in a series of earthquakes in the Yakutat Bay region during September 1899.  This catastrophic event caused a maximum uplift of 47 feet on the western side of Disenchantment Bay, and was felt over an area estimated at least 216,300 square miles on land.  A number of separate tsunamis were triggered by both tectonic uplift in Yakutat Bay and submarine and subaerial landslides from Valdez to Lituya Bay.  Glacier regimen alteration also occurred in the area.\r\n<p>The following is from reference #415:\r\n<br />The tectonic movements and, to some extent, the collapse of large masses of ice and rocks into the water, were the cause of the appearance of a tsunami and seiches...The tongue of the Hubbard glacier broke off on a stretch of 9 km (5 miles) and slipped 1 km (half a mile) into the bay. Water poured out of the small lake and rushed downwards.\r\n<br />At Yakutat, according to eyewitnesses, the water became very agitated after the earthquake, and at least until nightfall the level rose and fell 2 1/2-3 m (8-10 feet) every 8-10 minutes.\r\n<br />According to one account, as soon as the earthquake had ended, flood tides rolled in from the sea. There were at least three large waves. The water level rose from the ebb tide mark, which occurred at the time of the earthquake, to 0.3 m (1 foot) above the high tide mark, that is, it rose 4 1/2 m (15 feet). Eddies formed in the bay, in which trees, driftwood and all kinds of rubbish circled so rapidly that it was difficult to follow individual objects. The water foamed up and was covered with whitecaps on the whole expanse. Reaching the chute of the sawmill, the whirlpool tore it off and carried it away in an instant.\r\n<br />According to another eyewitness, after the earthquake the water in the bay began to retreat stormily and passed the line of the lowest low tides. Soon afterwards, the water returned in a strong current and covered the shore over a considerable stretch. Everything around the Indian huts was flooded and washed away, and the huts themselves were very nearly washed away.</p>",

The rise of water along the vertical was 4.5-5 m above the level of regular flood tides. The ebbs and floods recurred 4-5 times.

Six foot waves washed out sections of railroad, and flooded stations at Surf and Pismo. Observed at Avila. Recorded in Hawaii and at Ft. Point and La Jolla. Tectonic source probably but effects also similar to 1878 submarine landslide event. of 10 feet and a very restricted affected area. This tsunami affected about 35 miles of shore line. Validity 4. (reference #237)\r\n<p>The Lompoc earthquake of 4 November 1927 (MS 7.0) was one of the largest offshore events in California, and the associated tsunami was recorded in Hawaii as well as on the California coast. The epicenter of this event has long been debated; one location is offshore where the ocean is about 1000-m deep, whereas another location is very near shore beneath a water depth of less than 100 m... Both the arrival times and waveforms of the recorded tsunami of the 1927 Lompoc earthquake indicate that it occurred offshore at about 34.2<sup>o</sup>N, 120.75<sup>o</sup>W, where the water depth is about 1000 m... Using the mechanism solution obtained by them, the seismic moment is estimated to be 3 X 10<sup>26</sup> dyne-cm, corresponding to Mw &#61; 7.0. This value is consistent with the surface-wave magnitude, indicating that tsunami excitation is similar to that expected from surface waves. The large tsunami observed at Hilo is due to the bathymetric effects near Hilo Bay. The tsunami magnitude estimate of 7.6 made by Abe (1979) is apparently an overestimate because of this effect. (reference #3796)\r\n</p><p>1927, November 4, 5:51. There was a strong earthquake with source on the edge of the shelf on the northern boundary of the Murray - fault zone. Large slides took place on the coast in the Santa Barbara district, and the movement of traffic on the railway was interrupted. Flues were damaged at Lompoc and other coastal settlements. A very strong seaquake was felt on the &#34;Sokonia&#34; 50 km (27 miles) from Arguello Point, on the &#34;Alaska Standard&#34;, 25 km (15 miles) from the same cape and on other vessels.\r\n</p><p>A tsunami arose, which was observed on the coast of California and was registered on the Hawaiian Islands. An employee from Surf reported that there was a wave &#39;approximately 1 1/2 - 2 m (6 feet) high, which began with the crest. A railway employee at Port San Luis observed a fall and rise in water level of 1 1/2 m (5 feet) followed by oscillations in level for an hour. According to the lighthouse attendant, in the same port a rise occurred, followed by a drop of 11/4 m (4 feet), without subsequent substantial oscillations. An observer at Pismo Beach compared the tsunami with large storm waves.\r\n</p><p>The tsunami was registered by the tide gauges at Cape Fort (San Francisco), at San Diego and at La Jolla. On the first record, the oscillations began with a slow drop in level at 7:00, with a half period of 24 minutes. Then more rapid oscillations began with a period of about 15 minutes and a maximal amplitude of 4 cm. The sign of the first onset of the tsunami of the record at La Jolla is not definite. The oscillations had a period of 15 minutes, a maximal amplitude of 6 m and lasted about 13 hours.\r\n</p><p>At Hilo (Hawaiian Islands), the tsunami began 5.1 hours (at 8:33) after ebb tide, the maximal amplitude of oscillations was 10 cm, the period 12 minutes. At Honolulu, the tide gauge registered weak oscillations with an amplitude of 2 cm and a period of 20 minutes.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #415)</p>",

The Morobe district suffered most of the shock. Small tidal waves inundated the northern end of Salamaua and the bulk stores of Burns Philp and Co., Ltd., W.R. Carpenter and Co. Ltd., N.G. Goldfields Ltd., and Vacuum Oil Co., Ltd., suffered considerable damage. Numerous native houses collapsed and the natives fled in terror to the higher ground. Flood waters for a time cut off Salamaua from the Aerodrome. There was much minor damage, including the dislocation of telephone services. Numerous drums of petrol were swept by the tidal waves from the waterfront stores intot he swamp. Boats and launches were stranded. (reference #99)",

Canberra, Friday.--An earthquake described by U.S. seismologists as a &#34;rip - snorter&#34; occurred near Rabaul today, but no casualties resulted. Houses, tanks and power lines were damaged. There was no panic... Landslides brought trees to earth, smashing light and power lines and blocking roads. The epicentre of the upheaval was estimated within 30 miles and New Britain is still feeling reaction to a settling down somewhere under the sea. Water was sucked from Simpson Harbour, in which Rabaul nestles. It went and came back several times before the level became normal. An hour after the first shock at 2:30 a.m., water rose to an unusual height at Kokopo, beyond Blanche Bay, but quickly subsided.... It caused a tidal wave alert in Hawaii, but the warning was later cancelled. Another tremor shook Rabaul Town at 10 a.m.</p>",

Fifteen houses were destroyed, 22 &#34;affected&#34;; 2 boats were destroyed and 23 damaged. All along the affected area many temporary beach structures (kiosks) made of grass mats were swept away or damaged. Many boats were displaced, most dramatically from Samanco Bay south of Chimbote, where boats were displaced 300 m inland and remained beached there at the time of our survey. At Culebras, an unreinforced brick harbor wall was pushed over by the tsunami. At Coishco, some brick houses\r\nwere damaged, several reinforced brick:concrete factory walls were partially destroyed, and 400 tons of fish meal stored behind a brick and concrete wall were damaged or destroyed. <b>The fatalities including six line fishermen on the rocks at Coishco (Caleta Santa), four persons gathering firewood at the mouth of the Santa River, and two children on the beach looking for gold at Campo Santa.</b> The Civil Defense reported that evacuation took place in the Chimbote area after the earthquake and as the water retreated on the morning of 21 February. All deaths were in isolated regions, and it is unknown whether tsunami victims felt the earthquake, knew if they did to expect a tsunami, or saw the tsunami coming. \r\n<p>The tsunami on 21 February arrived at approximately mid-tide, on an outgoing tide. Throughout the surveyed region normal tidal range is between about 0.7 and\r\n1.1 m. \r\n</p><p>Since the tide gauge of Chimbote saturated after the initial rise of the tsunami, and the Salaverry and Callao records are truncated, eyewitness reports are invaluable.\r\nThe wave was generally described as black with no indications of breaking, occasionally with a hissing sound. Many recalled either two or three waves, usually in quick succession, with the second being the largest. The time between waves varied and at Coishco was reported near 8 min, at La Posa Huanchaco 9 minutes, at Playa Chimus 25 minutes. Many interviewees noted that during (and after) the\r\ntsunami the water became more turbulent, with bigger waves and a dirtier appearance. In El Dorado and Puerto Supe, eyewitnesses pointed to rocks and dock structures beyond which the water withdrew first. A number of eyewitnesses noted that the water remained high (or ponded) for 2-3 days.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #48)</p>",

Aegean Sea, eastern Greece. Island of Euboea, Gulf of Maliacus. Evidence provided by Thucidides indicates that a series of earthquakes occurred in the regions of Attica, Boeotia, Euboea in the autumn of 427 B.C. ... Several shocks in the summer and autumn of 426 B.C. occurred in the strait separating the Euboea Island from the continent. </p><p>According to eyewitness Demetrios Kallatianos, a significant part of the Lichades Island and the Cape Cenaeon sank under water. The shore near Orobies also sank and the coastal line shifted deep into dry land. The base of one of the peninsulas opposite the continental shore sank, and the Island of Atalanti appeared (Talantonissi). </p><p>After one of the earthquakes, the sea in Orobies retreated from the coastal line, but later on, coming back in the form of huge &#34;swelling&#34;, it partly flooded the settlement and this was repeated many times. According to Strabo, the waves flooded the shore three times, penetrating the continental coast of Greece 3-4 miles inland. Gullies in the vicinity of Tarfi, Thronium, Thermoplyles and Daphus were flooded, and many settlements were destroyed. A similar flood took place on the Atalanti Island: here, waves caught up triremes and dragged them along the shore for more than 2 miles; another trireme was torn away from a moorage and smashed against the walls. The sea also retreated from the coast in Peparithos and Skopelos, too, but no flood accompanied this process. The wave was observed in Opus near Kiparissi. On the eastern shore of Euboea Island no waves were observed. Judging from descriptions, a tectonic collapse occurred in the strait between the Euboea Island and the continent, resulting in great seiches. One must agree with Antonopoulos that possible local landslides of friable material were not the main cause of variations in the water level in the strait.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Ref #4139:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>426 BC June, earthquake magnitude 7.1, intensity X, 38 deg 54 min N, 22 deg 42 min E, tsunami intensity v, event validity 4.

Shortly after, the sea receded, and the harbour became dry. In Akku, the sea receded far off, more than one mile, uncovering the bottom, on which there happened to be many lost goods, and then flooded the coast with force. The sea retreated drying up the bottom for hundreds of yards in many harbours of Syria, Lebanon, Palestine. In Alexandria, the sea level rose, and it threw up a French ship onto the coast, together with many fish and sea animals and fragments of the city walls. The level of the Nile varied widely; ships sailing in the middle of the river and lying at anchor were thrown up onto the banks 15 m inland. The tsunami was observed on the Island of Rhodes, on the south - eastern shore of Peloponnesus, in the Adriatic Sea.

        "comments": "December, 1853, Tonga Islands. The following is an account of Sawkins (Sawkins, 1856; Perrey, 1861; Davis, 1928), about a very severe earthquake which may have been accompanied by a tsunami.\r\n<p>&#34;Several months prior to my arrival on the island of Tongatapu in 1854, an earthquake in the area had caused the northeast part of the island to subside, so that the ocean encroached here for 3 1/2 km (almost 2 miles) inland. Flooding occurred also, though to lesser extent, on the southeast coast of the island up to Nukualofa where, in a garden next to a completely demolished house, the water is now washing the roots of trees. The western shore of the island rose approximately one meter (several feet) and one of the springs that had been there previously disappeared underground.\r\n</p><p>&#34;Noteworthy also is the fact that the inundation of the northern and eastern shores, and the upheaval of the western and southern shores, was accompanied, at roughly the same time, by the appearance of a new island to the west. This fact was witnessed by many, including the captain of a whaling ship who previously had often sailed along that particular route and who, having grounded his ship on a sand bar near the new island, proceeded to land with a boat and crew on its western side. According to his account, the island was elevated about a decimetre (several inches) above the sea for a distance of 130 km (70 miles) and was covered with a black sand, exactly like the sand on the shores of other volcanic islands of this group and of the islands of Haapai. Moreover, hundreds of tons of sand were washing into the sea with each surf. I especially questioned the natives of Tongatapu whether they had previously seen anything similar to land in that direction, to which they replied negatively. The natives reckoned that the island had appeared on the very night when an earthquake had occurred (Christmas Eve, 1853) and when the ocean had inundated the land in Hihifo (Nord Point). \r\n</p><p>(above from reference #415)</p>",

A thick layer of ash and pumice covered the coast and Saint George&#39;s Channel. At Ghaie, a new cone was formed. At the site of the underwater eruption, a cone-shaped, but rather flat elevation 20 m high formed out of loose material. This later became Raluan (Baluan) Island. The eruption of the Raluan Volcano lasted three days, during which time total darkness reigned; fishes and turtles died. The eruption of the Ghaie Volcano lasted three weeks. Due to the prevailing northwest winds, the ejecta settled mainly in the sea, and on land only the regions immediately adjoining the volcanoes suffered.

On the other hand, in his description he says that on Sunday night, the 3rd February, very violent earthquakes were felt, followed by tidal waves on the Monday morning. Soon afterwards, clouds of steam were seen rising from the bay in a direct line between Tavurvur and Vulcan, and as the submarine crater increased in strength, these steam clouds ceased and the old crater burst out with terrific power. </p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #79:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>1878, February.

        "comments": "On March 26, 1947 [mistakenly listed as 1948] at 08:33 [local time] there was an earthquake with its source in the ocean near Gisborne. The quake generated a tsunami which arrived in Gisborne at 09:20 [local time]. The largest rise in the water level was observed about 15 km north of Gisborne on the low-lying shore between Whangara and Tatapuri. Eyewitness reports agreed that the second wave was the largest, for it reached a height of 9-10 m. Houses, roads and fields were damaged, although only a short distance of the shore was flooded. it is possible that the tsunami resulted from a landslide. (reference #415)\r\n<p>Just after 8.30am on March 26 1947 a moderate earthquake occurred off the northeast coast of the North Island, New Zealand. It was mildly felt in several places (maximum\r\nintensity MM4) along-the east coast, including Gisborne and Tolaga Bay. Half an hour after the earthquake a tsunami hit the coast, the tsunami being observed or its effect observable over a distance of, at least 115 km. It is possible that a small wave reached the Chatham Islands, over 600 km to the southeast. Fortunately, the coast along which the tsunami reached damaging heights was sparsely populated in 1947. Its greatest reported runup height of about 10m occurred at Tatapouri Point, and along the beach north of Turihaua Point, where it demolished a small beachside house, and carried away the decking and\r\nsuperstructure of a 16m span wooden bridge across the Pouawa River, depositing it about 800m upstream. Houses at Tatapouri and Mahanga were also structurally damaged, and water entered others at Makorori, Wainui Beach, and Kaiti Beach. Along the beach south of Mahanga, north and south of Young Nick&#39;s Head, at Makorori, Tatapouri and Pouawa, crops\r\nand/or fences were damaged. At Gisborne, three large bores and a number of smaller waves surged into the harbour and up the Turanganui River and its tributaries, but the water did not overtop the wharves nor did it do any damage along the river banks. Bores were also reported in other rivers between Young Nick&#39;s Head and Tolaga Bay. Two old bridges on the old coast road at Waihau Beach were swept away. Fish were reported washed ashore at Tatapouri and in large quantities, along the beach between Mahanga and Mahia.\r\n</p><p>The tsunami occurred less than half an hour before high tide (at Gisborne) and hence its effects were at near maximum. Several people observed the arrival of the first wave and none noted any effect that might suggest that the water retreated prior to the first large wave arriving. Hence the tsunami arrived with a leading elevation, or if there was a depression, it was minor.\r\n</p><p>According to one observer, the retreat of the first wave reduced the impact of the second, but the second wave appeared to be larger when it formed out to sea. At Tatapouri and Turihaua Point, the first two waves were reported as about 3-4 minutes apart, the water remaining at a high level for about ten minutes after the second wave. Gisborne harbour experienced three large surges, followed by smaller surges every 8-10 minutes for about two hours.\r\n</p><p>Although various accounts of the tsunami suggest arrival times ranging from 8 to 50 minutes after the earthquake, other accounts more reliably indicate arrival times at Pouawa, Gisborne and Mahia, of no less than about 25 minutes. Some accounts also record the direction\r\ntravelled by the wave. Some almost certainly represent refraction at headlands, and in bays, others are for the most part consistent with the location of the epicentre.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #2592)</p>",

The earthquake was reportedly felt more strongly than the March [25, 1947]\r\nevent (maximum intensity, MM5 at Gisborne, MM4 at Tolaga Bay). The tsunami affected about 50-60 km of coastline from Wainui Beach near Gisborne to north of Tolaga Bay, but caused little damage. As the weather was unfavourable, with rain squalls and a strong southeast gale, and the earthquake occurred at night, the tsunami itself was not observed, only its effects. Inland penetration may have been enhanced by storm driven waves. The tsunami reached its greatest reported run-up height at Waihau Beach, reaching further inland there than in March and disturbing timber set aside to repair the bridges damaged in March. The\r\ntsunami at Tolaga Bay was 1.8-2.4m higher than in March, based on the beach driftwood line. Tokomaru Bay was apparently unaffected. Gisborne Harbour Board reported no disturbance to water levels within the harbour. \r\n<p>One report suggests that the wave arrived at Tatapouri Hotel about half an hour after the quake, the owner of the hotel investigating after he heard a rush of water. Other reports for Tatapouri suggest that the wave arrived later, i.e. &#34;shortly before 8pm&#34;. At the time of the tsunami, the tide was ebbing, with low tide at Gisborne occurring at 10.23pm.

Fifteen minutes later a tidal wave eight feet high rolled into the bay from the south, traversing the entire length of the harbor - four miles. It had a speed of about twelve miles an hour. There were 200 vessels in the harbor bound eastward. Several were torn away from their anchorage. One ship loaded with coal and four heavily loaded barges were sunk. A three-masted schooner, 800 tons, was swept by the wave nearly a quarter of a mile like a cork, and now lies stranded on Sandy Point. Many other vessels were badly shaken and strained by the wave, but there is no means of communicating with them. Up the harbor the wave overturned small boats, parted the fastening of small vessels, and did damage to the New Haven Yacht Club. An overturned yawl was found at Morris&#39; Cove to-night, with a quantity of sailors&#39; clothing, splintered spars and loose-rigging, and thirty two hatches swept from vessels&#39; decks by the wave. It is now feared that other disasters have occurred.&#34;\r\n</p><p>The only event that the USGS (Reference #2043) lists in the eastern United States close to this date was near center Harbor, NH, on Dec. 17, 12 17 07 UTC, at 43.50 N, 71.50 W, with MMI intensity IV.

At least 3 people killed and 7 missing due to a 7.6 meter tsunami caused by rockslides falling into a narrow fjord near Puerto Aisen. Felt (VII) at Puerto Aisen and Puerto Chacabuco, (VI) at Coihaique, (V) at Balmaceda and (IV) at Cochrane. (reference #1053) \r\n<p>The earthquake in the Region of Aysen generated landslides between the Island Mentirosa and Ri&#39;o Cuervo, generating a mass of earth that fell into the sea causing waves of great size that affected the coastal sectors and the salmon plants of the fiord of Aysen. Three people were killed and seven are missing. (ref #2684)\r\n</p><p>The earthquake produced a landslide in the fjord area close to Puerto Chacabuco. The landslide generated 3 waves, the biggest was about 6 meters and affected a local area. A tide gauge recorded only a 0.8 m. variation (10 km away from the landslide). (ref #2686)\r\n</p><p>On 21 April 2007, an Mw 6.2 earthquake produced an unforeseen chain of events in the Aysen fjord (Chilean Patagonia, 45.5 S). The earthquake triggered hundreds of subaerial landslides along the fjord flanks. Some of the landslides eventually involved a subaqueous component that, in turn, generated a series of displacement waves-tsunami- like waves produced by the fast entry of a subaerial landmass into a water body-within the fjord. These waves, with run-ups several meters high along the shoreline, caused 10 fatalities. In addition, they severely damaged salmon farms, which constitute the main economic activity in the region, setting free millions of cultivated salmon with still unknown ecological consequences... The combined results from all of these studies show that the large destructive waves were likely generated by the concurrent effects of the entry of subaerial landslides into the water body, the subaqueous destabilization of the fjord flanks linked to coastline retreat, and the sudden generation of the compressional ridges, which implied a vertical displacement of the fjord floor of up to 15 meters. (ref #10839)\r\n</p><p>April 1 (Ms 5,4) which triggered a small tsunami and caused some minor damages to the salmon farms near the epicentral zone. As a consequence, debris flows and tsunamis caused the death of three people and the disappearance of seven, in addition to severe damages to the salmon industry installations. The main areas affected by the tsunami were Punta Tortuga (one missing person), the mouth of R\u00edo Pescado, and Playa Blanca (Fig. 7; three dead and three missing people), the mouth of Rio Cuervo, Punta Camello (Caleta Dagny y Ensenada La Perra, one missing person), Isla Mentirosa, the mouths of Fr\u00edo and Fern\u00e1ndez rivers, Punta Yelcho, Caleta Bluff and Bahia Acantilada. <b>Note: reference #9790 clarifies that deaths were not all at this single location and that two deaths were due to landslides, not tsunami.</b>(ref #9790)\r\n</p><p>The displaced water masses formed swells estimated between 5 to 10 m in height for Aguas Calientes and probably more than 10 m for Isla Mentirosa, which seems to have been after the first wave. From these, in seconds, waves of tsunami were generated that reached speeds of radial propagation estimated between 360 and 600 km/h. The displaced waters left marks by direct impact of up to 50 m in the northern part of the Isla Mentirosa. The areas most impacted by the tsunami waves are: Punta Tortuga, mouth of Rio Pescado, Playa Blanca, mouth of Rio Cuervo, Punta Camello, Isla Mentirosa, estuary mouths of Frio and Fernandez, Punta Yelcho, Caleta Bluff and Bahia Acantilada.

Unusual movements of the sea were observed between the morning of April 24 and the morning of April 25 near the shores of Greece and on islands from the northern coast of the Island of Crete up to the Island of Limos. <p>Irregular quick rises and drops of the sea level were noted near the embankment of the port in Piraeus at 09h. Their period was approximately 10 min between 15&#34; and 16h30&#34; and at about 20h. The level rose up to 0.5 m (2 feet). In addition, noticeable flows were observed in front of the port and near its entrance. The 25 cm drop in the sea level was observed on the Island of Andros at 1Oh; suddenly, the level assumed its usual position after 1.5 hours. A sudden 40 - 50 cm rise in the sea level was observed on the Island of Syros at approximately 09h30m, a drop of approximately 20cm lower than the usual level followed after 5 min.\r\n</p><p>A rise and fall of sea level almost the same as on April 22 were observed in Karistos during the whole day, especially between 12h and 23h. Currents changed direction every 5 minutes; the sea would rapidly flow into the port and then recede, its level falling by 30 cm. A sudden rise over 0.5 m in the sea level was observed in Chalkida near the port and in the northern port at approximately 1l hth;is lasted about 15 min. The sea level was observed to rise a little relative to its usual position at 2zh together with an unprecedentedy rapid flow.\r\n</p><p>At approximately 10h, the sea receded from the coast of the Island of Mykonos in many places, especially near the village of Mykonos, where the sea receded for a distance of 15 - 20 m. At the same time, a similar phenomenon occurred in the port of Mykotios, where the water receded  approximately for 10 m. The water rose by 0.5 m on the Zslatid of Milos within the entire bay of the same name. </p><p>Workers in the port of Heruckon claimed that the sea level rose by 1 my other witnesses observed an insignificant rise in the level. Fishermen in a small\r\nboat 6 km to the east of Heracleon noticed a 0.5 m drop of the sea level, and the crew of a sailing vessel sailing 20 km to the west of the town noticed a similar rise of the level at about 12h. According to an engineer of the port of Heracleon, the sea surface at first rose and subsided rapidly; the amplitude of these oscillations increased gradually. A strong wave 2m high rolled up onto the\r\ncoast at approximately 14h; the water covered the parapet of the pier. An offshore current followed immediately after the wave with such a force that the fishing boats near the port were carried out into the open sea. Then the currents\r\nweakened gradually and ceased altogether by 07h on the following day, i.e. on April 25. According to a report of the director of the weather bureau in Heracleon, the sea currents had a velocity of about 6 knots.\r\n</p><p>The water receded from the coast by approximately 1.5 m as a result of a lowering of the sea level in Nafplio at 14&#39;30m. The reverse flow appeared several minutes later, and the normal level was exceeded by 0.5 m. Then, the water receded again, and the level returned into its usual position. According to accounts, a similar phenomenon took place on the shore of Tolo, 12 km from Nafplio.\r\n</p><p>Judging from the onset time of the tsunami in various places, the source of waves more or less coincided with the focus of the main earthquake on April 22 and with its aftershock on April 24, the data on which were given above. But the waves, apparently, began 5 hours after the shock. It can therefore be assumed that they were caused by a powerful underwater landslide. (reference #2130)</p>",

Soon after the earthquake, or seaquake, that occurred at Cabenda, and which extended to some distance to the southward and northward of the port, a flight of locusts took place, that continued three days and three nights, so that the sea was literally covered with their drowned carcasses; ... the earthquake, which had preceded their flight only a few hours, drove in upon the shore from\r\nthe westward several tremendous seas, so as to cause\r\nsome of the vessels when in the trough of them to strike the ground in five and a half fathoms water. <b>Many of the natives, both here [Cabenda], and at Malemba, were drowned</b> upon the beach, in consequence of it being so very narrow, and the cliffs which bound it so extremely precipitous, that they could not escape the overwhelming waves which came suddenly upon them. To this calamity, was added, the destruction of many canoes, by this sudden inundation of the sea ... . This is quite clearly the description of a relatively large seismic sea-wave associated with an earthquake which was felt over a very large area of West Africa. (reference #1214)",

Chile tsunami occurring in August 1869 is uncertain. Berninghausen, citing Heck, Milne and Montessus de Ballore lists tsunamis accompanying a quake Aug. 19 at Ica and Arica and a quake (quakes? ) on Aug. 20 and 24 at Tacna, Arica, Iquique, and Pica. Heck lists the same tsunami, not clarifying that the places were those at which the quakes, and not necessarily waves, were observed, citing Milne. Milne listed a quake at Arica and Ica on 19 Aug., accompanied by sea waves, citing an unidentified Montessus de Ballore report, and quakes Aug. 20-24 strongest at Arica, Iquique, and Pica, of which one at least was accompanied by sea waves, citing Fuchs, Montessus de Ballore, and Hope-Jones. Rudolph initially (1887) reported a quake at Tacna on Aug. 24 at 13:10 with which was associated the tsunami behavior at Pisagua noted above. Later, however, he quoted a ship captain&#39;s report from Pisagua on the same date that &#34;..the inhabitants cleared out to the mountains leaving another sea wave.&#34; The earlier tsunami thus implied might have occurred on one of the earlier dates shown in Aug. 1869 or might easily have been the tsunami of 1868 Aug. 13. Montessus de Ballore included in his provisional lists (1910-llb) a quake at Arica and Ica on Aug. 19 that was accompanied by a tsunami, but later (19lla) in detailed account omitted this date and described a Peru-N. Chile quake on Aug. 24 accompanied by a tsunami at Arica and Iquique. Fuchs (1870) mentions a tsunami only on Aug. 24 accompanying a quake at Iquique and Arica. It is considered probable that there was only one tsunami in Aug. 1869, that on the 24th, but possible that there was an additional one on the 19th. (reference #79)</p>",

It fell down into the sea in about 10 seconds, generating a small tsunami in the bay between Point Nere and Point Luccia. This part of the island is completely uninhabited.

The landslide mass was estimated through models of the terrain inferred from photogrammetric campaigns carried out in 1981 and 1991. (reference #1315)</p><p>On April 20 1988 a landslide of approximately 200,000 cubic meter occurred on NE flank of volcano La Fossa on the island of Vulcano. The volcanic activity of the cone of La Fossa increased in 1987-1988 starting in June 1987, with measured ground deformations and with a seismic swarm on 9-14 August 1988. The direct cause of the slide is difficult to ascertain: the simplest hypothesis is that the mass was pushed to a critical stability point by seismic vibrations associated with the earthquake sequence affecting the region surrounding Vulcano from March to June 1988. Some other causes can be invoked, such as hot fluid circulation in the hydrothermal system (Tinti r533). The landslide entered the sea generating a tsunami. Instrumental data do not exist since no tide gauges were present in the area, but the tsunami was clearly observed especially in the harbour of Porto di Levante. Observational data are from eyewitnesses (Tinti r533). A fisherman, who at the time of the landslide, was in his boat just inside the generation area, reports that at about 5:30 am local time he heard a big noise and, looking at the coast, he had the impression that the mountain was running towards him. A positive wave was excited that raised the boat without damaging it. The water wave was approximately 1-2 m high. Then he felt the boat go down, and other smaller oscillations followed the fist wave. Another boat in the same bay but further from the source, was impacted by the tsunami with no damage. In the harbour of Porto di Levante many people observed sudden waves entering the harbour, similar to those produced in the sea by a storm, but the weather was fine with no wind. Wave amplitude was estimated to be approximately 0.5 m. Information (not from eyewitnesses) about observed waves as 0.5m amplitude in some places on Lipari island are reported. Tsunami intensity 2.

At each recoil of this tremendous surf the whole space between the channel further than Blockade was laid nearly bare, so as to discover frightful rocks and fragments, that before had never been visible. The water dashed against the barrack pale, &amp; at the next returned reached to their very top, in one dreadful mass threatening destruction to the whole town; and our fears suggested, that had it then broke upon us its fury must have been irresistible: this happily was not the case, though many houses were much damaged, and one swept totally away. This rage of the element continued the whole night; nor did the tide recover its usual flow until the third day following. Between us and the Little Island many rocks appeared at intervals which had ever before been secreted from the eye by a depth of water. In Pigrun Bay, from the exposed situation of which such a rapid surf would be less unaccountable, no difference was visible, nor was any part of the Island, to the eastward of Far Bay, at all affected, tho&#39; an easterly wind prevailed almost the whole time.&#34; (ref #11623)\r\n<p> A private letter received by the Ferret from Norfolk Island, of May 23 says, &#34;the weather has for many weeks past been frightfully tempestuous, insomuch that no boat could at any time with safety put off from the shore; and on the 11th of the present month it were the most serious and distressing appearance, exhibiting a phenomon at the same time never before witnessed. At half past four in the afternoon, then low water, the surf began to beat with unusual violence and rapidity, at frequent intervals occasioning an influx into the town of <b>16 feet perpendicular height</b>; the consequences of which were severely felt by the houses in the lower row, the backs of which were beat down and washed away with the surf, which with equal velocity returned to the low water mark. It continued thus, with little abatement, until one in the morning of the 12th, when happily the consternation was removed with its cause; but during the continuance of which every building within the possible reach of the exasperated element was emptied of its contents. A number of inhabitants have suffered by the deluge, which, had it unfortunately happened at high tide, it is supposed must have swept away the whole town of Sydney (ref #11624)\r\n</p><p>In the month of May, 1805, Norfolk Island experienced a considerable influx of the sea, which, from the extraordinary nature of the occurrence, is worthy of mention. The tide first ebbed to a great distance; when, suddenly, an unusual swell was seen coming in, which occasioned considerable alarm to the colony, to whom such a circumstance was entirely novel: it rose to a great height, and retired to its channel. A second time it revisited the shore, and flowed to a more considerable height than before: a second time it retreated; and once again returned, with a fury surpassing its former efforts; paralyzing the spectators with terror, who were unable to imagine where the extraordinary swellings might pause. For the last time, however, the ocean left the shores, without having caused any material damage; and, in its regress, it opened the secrets of the deep, and displayed to &#34;mortal ken&#34; rocks which had remained until now undiscovered.

The central (main) crater erupted with billowing clouds, weak to moderate explosions, lava flows, and caused strong earthquakes  and a tsunami. The height of the ash column was 300 m. The area of volcanic deposition was 1 km<sup>2</sup>, the thickness was 10 m at 100 m from the source, and the maximum length of the flow was 300 m. (reference #417)\r\n<p>On 6 September [at about 1800], the people of Neo village on Trevanion island heard a low, continuous thundering sound coming from the volcano. At the same time a thick dark cloud poured from its summit until the sea between the volcano and Travanion Island, including the two Neo villages facing it, was engulfed in this low-lying thick dark smoke. The thundering sound and the dark smoke went on for about two hours. At about 2000 there was a sudden burst of a louder sound. Simultaneously, a huge flame shot up from the summit of the volcano. This flame was described as later dividing into two corkscrew-like tongues of fire, one slanted to the E and the other to the W side of the volcano.\r\nThere was no panic shown by the people who watched the episode at this stage as the older people assured the younger ones that the volcano used to behave in this manner many years ago and that they should not be alarmed. However, the comforting words did not last very long because about 30 minutes after the flame died down they heard the roaring sound of the breaking waves coming towards their shores. As the night was very bright with the moonlight, they saw that the sea began to recede in an unusual manner. Knowing that a [tsunami] was coming the families began to gather in groups and move to higher ground. Fortunately the sea did not reach the houses and no injuries occurred. ...\r\nAnother flame or fire flared up at about 0300 on 7 September and its subsequent [tsunami] was observed at 0630 traveling NE from the volcano.

It generated a tsunami that &#34;caused severe destruction in the [Stromboli] island, produced some damage in the Aeolian archipelago, and was observed in several coastal places in the south-Tyrrhenian sea&#34; (ref #2439).</p><p>On 30 December at 1315 and 1322 two landslides suddenly formed along the Sciara del Fuoco. As they traveled down the volcano&#39;s flank they produced wet, fine ashfall (less than 0.1 mm in size) on the island&#39;s SE side. The first landslide had a volume of about 600,000 m3, the second about 5,000,000 m3, and they both reached the sea. Upon contact with the sea the landslides produced two tsunamis with waves that were several meters high. The tsunamis injured few people, and damaged buildings and boats in the villages of Stromboli and Ginostra. Large waves were reported as far away as the town of Milazzo, on Sicily&#39;s N coast, 60 km S of Stromboli... According to several news articles, volcanic activity at Stromboli on 30 December caused a landslide, which entered the sea and generated a tsunami. The articles stated that in the small village of Ginostra, waves injured six people, and damaged homes and boats. Residents and tourists were evacuated to nearby Sicily. (ref #2432)</p><p>During the last months of 2002 Stromboli was dominated by an intense explosive activity that lasted till December 28. On that day Stromboli started a new effusive phase that compromised the stability of the Sciara del Fuoco flank leading to the landslides of December 30. It has been ascertained that two different landslides occurred in that day. The first one occurred at 13:15 and it was mainly a submarine one, whereas the second one, occurred 7-8 min later and produced a subaerial scar on the Sciara del Fuoco at a height of 500 m a.s.l., for a volume of about 7-8 million cubic meters. The mass moved by the first landslide was much greater than the sub-aerial one, and bathymetric surveys revealed that the total volume of the material moved by the two slides was about 20 million cubic meters. According to Tinti both landslides produced tsunami waves: the first event was characterized by a first negative sea movement, while the second produced a positive wave. The submarine slide caused a sea level lowering of about 10-15 m at the foot of the Sciara, immediately propagating in both directions, northward towards Piscit\u00e0 and southward towards Ginostra. A destructive tsunami, starting with an initial slow withdrawal, violently invested the northern coasts of the island with three-four big waves. It has been ascertained that within a few minutes the water invaded Ficogrande beach, and attacked Punta Lena and Scari producing severe damage. The second tsunami was generated around 13:22 by a subaerial mass failure. Only a few people were able to distinguish the arrival of the second tsunami and to recognize the positive leading wave, while most considered it as the continuation of the first. Several field surveys were undertaken soon after the event both in the near and far-field. The strongest tsunami effects were observed at Stromboli. In the beach called Spiaggia Longa (north-eastern coast) the highest value of runup (10.90 m) was measured. At Piscit\u00e0 the buildings located near the shore were seriously damaged. (ref #4139)</p><p>The total volume of the involved material was about 20,000,000 m3, the largest contribution coming from the submarine displacement [...] Low season visitor numbers to the island determined that only minor injuries were reported; otherwise, the victim toll might have been much higher.

        "comments": "46 AD July 6. Thera. At the same time as an eclipse of the Moon, probably following a subdued eruption, an islet, which became known as Theia, rose up from the sea between Thera and Therasia in the Cyclades.\r\n<p>This event is well documented by contemporary authors, including Seneca, who confirms that it happened in his own time and during the consulship of Valerius Asiaticus (AD 46). Dio Cassius dates it Roman year 800 (AD 47), while St Jerome gives the fifth year of Olympiad CCVI (AD 45), and notes the length of the island as 30 stadia (5.5 km). Orosius (writing early in the fifth century AD) dates it to the fifth year of Claudius (AD 45-46).\r\n</p><p>Since Aurelis Victor mentions that it happened on the same night as a lunar eclipse, there is a chance of dating the eruption accurately. Schove and Fletcher (1987, 9-11) derive several dates, noting that the most popular is 31 December AD 46, because this would embrace both Seneca&#39;s date of AD 46 and Dio&#39;s of AD 47. However, he thinks that 6 July AD 46 is more probable because the eclipse would have been distinctly noticeable by about 8.53 pm, and consequently more likely to be recorded.\r\n</p><p>One must beware of confusing this eruption with that of Hiera in 199-198 BC, since the two occurrences were very similar in nature. Pliny mentions both, but the dates in the relevant passage are notoriously unreliable. Pliny&#39;s date, 8 July of the 110th year after the fourth year of Olympiad CXLV, works out as AD 3. This is due in part to a scribal error in an early copy of Pliny&#39;s works, when many events were assigned to Olympiad CXXXV.\r\n</p><p>Modern cataloguers associated this eruption with the Crete earthquake of 62-64, dating it 53/52/66. Guidoboni (1989, 661-662), Guidoboni et al. (1994, 193-194) associate this eruption at Thera with the Crete earthquake of 62-64, dating it 53/52/66 for which I have no evidence.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #9116)\r\n</p><p>46 A.D. Crete.

        "comments": "1853-1854. Validity 4 with some uncertainty on the date. A massive wave in Lituya Bay cleared trees to a height of 120 meters.  The occurrence of the wave is evidenced by a well-marked zone in the forest on either shore of the bay, the demarcation line of which separates two tree populations of differing ages.  Growth ring dating of the younger, lower trees indicated that a wave had cleared the forest between the growing season of August 1853 and May 1854. It is believed that the wave was generated by a rockslide on the south shore of the bay.  The report of many drowned at Dry Bay between 1850 and 1860 is probably associated with this tsunami. Native histories variously suggest from 8-10 war canoes with 8 men each were lost, to the loss of an entire village, as possible results of this event. It is tempting to combine these events with the poorly dated account of the 1845 glacier collapse in Disenchantment Bay and the 1847 Sitka earthquake. However, the tree-ring date for the Lituya Bay seems to fix that event to near the 1853-1854 period but an under-counting is possible. Therefore, these are considered as separate events [1845-1847 and 1853-1854]; the Lituya Bay event does not seem to have been associated with an earthquake. This is the earliest of five landslide tsunamis reported for Lituya Bay by Miller (1960). (Ref #239)\r\n<p>The following is from reference #415:\r\n</p><p>1853/1854. During studies in Lituya Bay, mainly in 1948 and in 1952-1953, clear traces of the past effects of a strong wave were found. Namely, along the northern and in places along the southern shore of the Bay, an age-old forest grew, beginning only at a certain well-marked boundary. Below this boundary and as far as the zone of flood tides, there grew only a young forest. Judging by the number of rings on trunk sections, it was established that the wave arose between the middle of August 1853 and the beginning of May 1854.\r\n</p><p>The maximal known height of this boundary is 120 m (395 feet) above mean sea level; the maximal distance from the water line is 750 m (2500 feet); the known area of the zone of destruction of forest is 3 1/2 km squared. Judging from the remaining traces of erosion, the destructive force of the wave of 1853/1854 was little less than that of the waves of 1958. \r\n</p><p>According to Indian legend, in the 60&#39;s of the XIX century, at the exit from Lituya Bay, eight canoes with people were lost in a sudden flood. The cause of the waves is unknown.</p>"

In this paper we review the potential causes for this landslide based on an integrated study of eye witness testimony, swath bathymetry data and stability analyses. Results show that the Sokkelvik landslide was most likely triggered by intense rainfall and snowmelt, but that the main cause is associated to the load of an up to 7.5 m high embankment fill. This fill was placed at the shoreline for road construction 6 months before the landslide. Results presented herein show the importance of accounting for extreme rainfall events and groundwater flow when planning construction activity in sensitive near shore areas. (reference #11863)</p>",

Cox and Morgan (1977, p. 29-32) show that these choices are largely untenable and consider it to be a probable tsunami of uncertain but remote source. There was a magnitude 7-7.75 aftershock of the August 13, 1868, Arica event on August 24th, and it is tempting to think there was an error of one\r\nmonth in the earthquake date. However, Kausel (1987) reports that the August date is confirmed. (Ref #236)\r\n<p>1869 (1868) July (?) 25. There was an unusual flood tide on the coast of the Puna district.

The water rose 9 m or 3-4 1/2 m higher than the tsunami of 2.IV.1868 and passed tens of metres inland in a foaming roller. Homes which had survived the flooding of 1868 were washed away. [The surveys of perceptible earthquakes in the world for 1869 give no information about strong earthquakes along the Pacific coasts on July 24-25. The description of events for Kalapana is identical to the description of the earthquake and tsunami of 2.IV.1868. Possibly the date is mistaken] (Reference #415).</p>"

The wave - in modern parlance probably a &#34;sea surge&#34; - was not forty-five feet, but just 1.9 metres high, yet much bigger than any of the kanaka had ever experienced. Kling reports in the war diary that the sea was so high that it actually entered their tents. The forty metre-long jetty built by the captives was totally obliterated; most of the provisions which had been stored on the little island near the entrance to the lagoon were swept away into the ocean, and that island was under a metre of water.

This picture appears to show the Seeadler in her position at anchor before she swung around, struck the coral reef and had to be abandoned on 2 August. In the foreground is the entrance to the lagoon and part of the small island  used by the crew to store  provisions salvaged from the ship, until a 1.9-metre sea surge swept them into the sea on 1 September 1917.

According to the description, the wave impacted the Levantine coast with effects recorded at Caesarea and Yavne. The tsunami was likely caused by a powerful earthquake that destroyed the city of Antioch (Ambraseys and Jackson, 1998) and originated somewhere along the eastern Cyprean Arc (Ben-Avraham et al., 1995). The construction of Caesarea&#39;s harbor by Herod the Great in 21 B.e. is well documented by excavation work and descriptions of the harbor by the historian Josephus Flavius (Whiston, 1999; Holum et al., 1988). The reasons for the rapid decline in the harbor, about one century later, are less c1ear, and heavily debated (Reinhardt and Raban, 1999; Hohlfelder, 2000). However, the favored interpretation has been the catastrophic destruction of the harbor by an earthquake; although the role of a tsunami has been considered, no conclusive evidence has ever been found (Raban, 1992, 1999; Reinhardt and Raban, 1999; Mart and Perecman, 1996). Records of sub-recent (past 2000 yr) tsunamis in the eastern Mediterranean are based primarily on textual records with variable accuracy (e.g., Neev et al., 1973; Amiran et al., 1994; Mart and Perecman, 1996; Ambraseys and Jackson, 1998; Karcz, 2004), none of which has been substantiated with geological or archaeological evidence.

Then the sea level rose and the waves &#34;rushed and rolled&#34; with such force that three small vessels of 60-100 tons displacement, which were riding at anchor in the open road, were tossed over the hill on which the town was situated.

The town was completely washed away, but later it was rebuilt 5 1/2 km ( 3 miles) from shore and only a solitary sandy hill remains at the former site of the town.

        "comments": "1751, May (erroneously March) 24 or 25 (after 01:00, local time) there was a destructive earthquake and tsunami in Concepcion. The shock that occurred on the 26th was almost as strong as that of the 25th.<p>The ocean began to recede about half an hour after the quake, and soon the half dressed, frozen and frightened inhabitants of Concepcion climbed the neighbouring hills from where they witnessed the approach of a strong sea wave descending upon the shore. The tsunami flooded the town (then situated in the site of Penco), and washed away the wreckage of buildings and domestic utensils. Seven minutes later the ocean returned with great force &#34;the waves crowded one on another,&#34; and the water level exceeded its usual limits; the water burst into the town with a speed exceeding that of a galloping horse, completely inundating the town. The water advanced quickly along the river, rising and inundating the adjacent areas and flooding even houses on higher ground. Boats and canoes were hurled into the church of San Francisco, located 400-500 m from shore. Subsequently, the water receded, again quite rapidly, carrying with it walls, some of which were still intact, and household items. Where the town had stood there was nothing but an impassable heap of ruins. And in the Cantarranos quarter, only the piles of the houses were left, all the rest having been washed away. Then the water receded again, just as on the previous occasion, but it rose and inundated the area two more times, the third flooding being the most severe. </p><p>The next morning it was established that the water level had varied considerably; in some areas the water had risen more than 3.5 m (4 varas), in others less. <b>Twenty-five to thirty old persons and invalids (17 persons, according to other accounts) were drowned</b> in the waves of the tsunami - the only victims of the earthquake. </p><p>The vessel &#34;St. Anthony and Family,&#34; loaded with goods and passengers, lay at anchor in the port of Concepcion. The seaquake was very severe and it was feared the vessel might be destroyed, but it survived. With the first strong ebb, the anchor chain broke, and the ship itself was grounded, listing heavily. The returning tide hit the vessel, causing it to list the other way. Then the vessel found itself floating. Subsequently, the sea rose 17 m (9 1/2 fathoms) and the ship was thus refloated. There were three strong tides and ebbs, and each time the vessel became grounded. </p><p>After this destructive flood - the fourth and most severe in the history of the city - Concepcion was rebuilt farther  from the shore, and its old location was eventually used to build the new town of Penco. The tsunami was also recorded in Valparaiso. </p><p>The waves hit the island of Juan Fernandez, washed away a settlement and sank a vessel anchored in the port. <b>The governor of the island, his family along with 35 other persons perished</b>. </p><p>The tsunami reached threatening proportions in Callao; but no one died</p><p>There are some reports to the effect that the bottom of Concepcion Bay had risen 7 m (24 feet) during the earthquake; the resulting shoal consisted of hard sandstone rather than sand.</p><p>Naturalists who later visited the area of Concepcion, found, in areas of considerable elevation, many mollusc shells which were packed with river sand; such shells normally occur in the littoral zone.</p><p>The tsunami reached the southeastern coast of the island of Honshu, flooding the houses on Otsuki on the Djika peninsula and in Kesennuma to above the floors, but there were no deaths.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #415)</p>",

        "comments": "In 1783 Calabria (southern Italy) was shaken by the most violent and persistent seismic crisis occurred in the last two thousands years. Five very strong earthquakes occurred in a short interval of time (February-March), causing destructions and a lot of victims in a vast region embracing the whole southern Calabria and the Messina area, Sicily. Very likely the earthquake is not directly responsible for the tsunami (at the epicentre, waves observed about half an hour later than the ground shaking). Tsunami probably due to a huge earthquake-induced rockfall: a portion of the Monte Campalla (south-western side of the Scilla beach) collapsed into the sea. The front of the failing mass was about 450 m long and penetrated the sea at most by 100 m (Minasi, ref #4125). On the other hand, it was estimated to be more than 2 km long with detachment occurring at a distance ranging from 500 to 2 km onshore and penetreting the sea by a distance of 110 m (De Lorenzo, ref #4132).\r\n<p>At Scilla most of the people, frightened by the sequence of earthquakes, escaped to the open beach and were surprised by the unexpected waves that reached the roof of the buildings. Total number of tsunami <b>victims exceeding 1500</b> (Galimi, ref #4126; Mercalli, ref #4134). Few seconds after the rockfall the sea inundated the district of Marina Grande, reaching the first ffloor of buildings, then it the cliffs of the Castle at Monasina. The water climbed the Livorno stream op to 200 m from the sea shore, then reached Chianalea and Marina dell&#39;Oliveto, located on the other side of the promontory. Three big inundations were observed. At Marina Grande the Santo Spirito church was destroyed, the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie, located at a distance of 90m from the shore was inundated as well as San Nicola church. A woman entangled in a mulberry tree at an height of 8.3 m near the Gornelle fountain. According to Sarconi (ref #4124) in Marina Grande (Scilla) inundation heights in the range of 6-9 m observed, while according to Minasi (ref #4125) wave height of 16 m. At Nicotera the sea withdrew then inundated the shore carrying some fishing boats. Also Bagnara affected by the inundation. Cannitello was affected by the waves. At Messina the sea was seen to rise and noisily overflow its coast. According to Minasi (ref #4125) sea level rose of about 2 m. Tsunami also quite relevant at the headlight. At Peloro, near Torre del Faro, flooding of a long stretch of fields, close to the Pantanello small lake. Small houses, people and animals carried seaward. At Torre del Faro coast flooded for about 600 paces. Some boats and 26 victims carried seaward. Run-up height about 6 m. At Punta del Pezzo and surrounding areas sea covering the beach for one and a half mile, leaving some sand on the ground.

The source was apparently situated in the coastal region of Odose, and possibly also under the floor of the sea. The earthquake destroyed 164 homes and caused a small tsunami. Twelve people died in the earthquake and tsunami.</p><p> According to chronicles, some more or less marked changes in the relief of the earth&#39;s surface occurred in the area of the source before the earthquake. In the morning, it was noted that the sea had begun to retreat, and the ground was bulging in places. The residents of Ajigasawa took this as a sign of a tsunami and began to take to less dangerous places. However, the mountains and cliffs collapsed as a result of the shock. In panic, people fled from the landslides and rolling stones to the seaside. At that time, a tsunami wave approached the coast; there were victims. It is possible however, that all this is exaggerated. According to a later account of the effects of this earthquake, there were no victims of the earthquake at Ajigasawa. \r\n</p><p>Nanatsuishi (eastern part of the city of Ajigasawa) suffered comparatively heavily. A wave flooded and washed away homes and fishing boats. The settlement of Maido suffered still more greatly from the tsunami. There were victims here; the bridge spanning the river fell.

The New Madrid earthquakes\r\ngenerated several waves in the rivers. &#34;At first the Mississippi seemed to recede from its banks, its waters gathered up like mountains, leaving boats high upon the sands. The waters then moved inward with a front wall 15 to 20 feet (5 - 7 m) perpendicular and tore boats from their moorings and carried them up a creek closely packed for a quarter of a mile. The river fell as rapidly as it had risen and receded within its banks with such violence that it took with it a grove of cotton wood trees. A great many fish were left upon the banks. The river was literally covered with the wrecks of boats.&#34; (Fuller, 1912)\r\n<p>&#34;A bursting of the earth just below the village of New Madrid, arrested this mighty stream in its course, and\r\ncaused a reflux of its waves, by which in a little time a great number of boats were swept by the ascending current\r\ninto the mouth of the bayou, carried out and left upon the dry earth, when the accumulating waters of the river had\r\nagain cleared their current. On the Mississippi great waves were created, which overwhelmed many boats and washed\r\nothers high upon the shore, the return current breaking off thousands of trees and carrying them out into the river.\r\nHigh banks caved and were precipitated into the river, sand bars and points of islands gave way, and whole islands\r\ndisappeared. (Fuller, 1912)\r\n</p><p>Unusual lake water level rises were seen at Lake Bistineau near Texas-Louisiana border. Lake Caddo, in the\r\nsame area, was probably formed as a result of the earthquake and accompanying subsidence.\r\n(http://www.lakebistineau.com/history/1919article.html, http://www.ops.tamu.edu/x075bb/caddo/caddo.html.)\r\n</p><p>At Orchard Lake, Michigan, it was reported that on December 17, 1911 &#34;the Indians said the waters of the\r\nlake began to boil, bubble, foam and roll about as though they had been in a large kettle over a hot fire, and that in\r\na few minutes up came great numbers of turtles, and hurried to shore, upon which they had a great turtle feast.&#34;\r\n(Hobbs, 1911; Bricker, 1977) Validity 3.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #541)\r\n</p><p>On the river a number were drowned. Bradbury mentions seeing drifting canoes, the owners of which he afterward found had been lost. Hildreth describes the loss of several boats and their crews by caving banks. Lloyd records that a flat boat belonging to Richard Stump was swamped and six men drowned. Many other boats were destroyed by snags and the river was covered with wrecks. So numerous were the disasters that the escape and arrival at Natchez of Capt. Roosevelt with the steamer New Orleans was regarded as almost miraculous. (reference #1854)</p>",

A tsunami occurred in the southern Kurile Islands and at Hokkaido.\r\n<p>The original account of the tsunami at Urup I. must be in the archives of the Russian-American Company. There are in existence two published accounts: Perrey (there is a Russian translation in Mushketov and Orlov, 1893) and P.N. Doroshin (1870).\r\n</p><p>Perrey got the account from F. P. Osten-Saken, secretary of the Russian Geographic Society in the &#39;60s and at the same time a responsible official in the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. At Perrey&#39;s request, Osten-Saken reviewed the records of the Russian-American Company for the years 1840-1860 and sent him all of the information that he found there concerning seismic and volcanic phenomena in the territories of the company.\r\n</p><p>P.N. Doroshin compiled a list of earthquakes in the same territories for the years 1840-1866 on the basis of similar material and also of his own notes which he made during his service with the Company.\r\n</p><p>Below we present the text of Doroshin with small additions from the text of Osten-Saken.\r\n</p><p>&#34;On April 13, 1843, at Urup at sunrise there were two strong shocks three seconds apart. They were preceded by a roar like distant thunder. The shocks came from the southwest and continued for seven seconds. After about three [?] minutes, with a fresh west wind, the water began to flow with terrible swiftness out of the bay [Aleutka] where the settlement was located, and the bottom of the bay was left completely dry. Then with the same speed the bay again filled with water and even inundated the shore to a considerable height. For several days the water was in constant movement; now it would come in, now go down, and each change was accompanied by a strong rip (agitation from the meeting of the currents).&#34;\r\n</p><p>This earthquake, apparently was one of the catastrophic ones, as it was observed on all of the southern Kurile Island and on the east coast of Hokkaido. In the Nemuro and Kushiro areas the earthquake attained destructive force. Thus, it is reported that in the town of Akkeshi, situated between these two points, one of the tombs was moved 1.5 m.; in the temple grounds fissures 10-15 cm. wide were formed. The earthquake was followed by destructive tsunamis; in the Kushiro area the height of the waves was 4.5 m. Especially affected by the tsunamis were the villages located on the shores of Akkeshi Bay which has the shape of a bent funnel, penetrating deeply into the land. In the village of Shinryu, at the bend of the funnel, all of the houses were washed away by the waves and <b>45 persons perished</b>.\r\n</p><p>According to Japanese estimates, the intensity (magnitude) of the earthquake was M &#61; 8.25 to 8.5. Taking into the account the considerable extent of the center of the quake and the area of occurrence of the tsunami, this estimates seems likely to be correct.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #413)\r\n</p><p>April 25, 1845, 42 N, 146 E, magnitude 8.4, tsunami intensity 2, validity 4. <b>46 deaths</b>, 75 houses destroyed.

A strong earthquake occurred in the region stretching about 550 km north of Iquique. This was the strongest shock since the earthquake of Aug 13, 1868. Numerous recurrent shocks were felt; foreshocks had been felt since at least Aug 20. According to a report from Lima, published by a French and some South American newspapers, the earthquake was followed on the coast of Peru by tsunami waves, almost as destructive as those of Aug 13, 1868. At Iquique and Arica, the sea receded rapidly from shore, entraining ships and boats. Then it returned in an enormous wave up to 2 m (6 feet) higher than the usual level. The wave retreated 5 times and then rolled onshore without much force. Normal life was totally disrupted. Homes were abandoned at Arica. The situation was almost the same at Iquique and Pisagua. At Pisagua, the sea level dropped 5 m, and then rose 2 m above its usual level. All ships, fearing that the anchors would not hold, made ready to put out to sea. (ref #415)<p>1869, Aug 24, 1:30 p.m. This poorly documented earthquake may have been a large aftershock near the southern end of the epicentral area of Aug 13, 1868.

Source Arica or Ica, N. Chile or S. Peru. Runups Iquique, Pisagua, Arica, Callao. The number and date of Peru-N. Chile tsunami occurring in Aug 1869 is uncertain. Berninghausen, citing Heck, Milne and Montessus de Ballore lists tsunamis accompanying a quake Aug. 19 at Ica and Arica and a quake (quakes? ) on Aug. 20 and 24 at Tacna, Arica, Iquique, and Pica. Heck lists the same tsunami, not clarifying that the places were those at which the quakes, and not necessarily waves, were observed, citing Milne. Milne listed a quake at Arica and Ica on 19 Aug., accompanied by sea waves, citing an unidentified Montessus de Ballore report, and quakes Aug. 20-24 strongest at Arica, Iquique, and Pica, of which one at least was accompanied by sea waves, citing Fuchs, Montessus de Ballore, and Hope-Jones. Rudolph initially (1887) reported a quake at Tacna on Aug. 24 at 13:10 with which was associated the tsunami behavior at Pisagua noted above. Later, however, he quoted a ship captain&#39;s report from Pisagua on the same date that &#34;..the inhabitants cleared out to the mountains leaving another sea wave.&#34; The earlier tsunami thus implied might have occurred on one of the earlier dates shown in Aug. 1869 or might easily have been the tsunami of 1868 Aug. 13. Montessus de Ballore included in his provisional lists (1910-llb) a quake at Arica and Ica on Aug. 19 that was accompanied by a tsunami, but later (19lla) in detailed account omitted this date and described a Peru-N. Chile quake on Aug. 24 accompanied by a tsunami at Arica and Iquique. Fuchs (1870) mentions a tsunami only on Aug. 24 accompanying a quake at Iquique and Arica. It is considered probable that there was only one tsunami in Aug. 1869, that on the 24th, but possible that there was an additional one on the 19th. (ref #79)</p>",

        "comments": "About 15-20 minutes after the earthquake, at approximately 0215, a wave from the sea poured onto the Denby cannery but caused no damage. Fifteen minutes after the first wave a second wave moved in from the southwest with a height of 11 m. It destroyed the structures on the sandspit and in southwestern part of Ust&#39;-Kamchatsk, passed up the river to the Ozernaia tributary and heaped up fragments of buildings and ice in it. The Kamchatka River was opened about a km and a half above its mouth; a new mouth was formed alongside the former one. <p>The old Denby cannery and the storehouses with goods and products were destroyed and in part washed into the ocean. Eighteen men were killed. The building of the radio-station survived but it was crammed with chunks of ice. The new Denby cannery suffered only in part. Of six cutter belonging to the Denby firm, four were jammed in the ice of the Ozernaia channel and the two others were thrown ashore. </p><p>In the southwest part of Ust&#39;-Kamchatsk six dwellings and several storage sheds, ice-houses, and smokehouses were destroyed, nine houses were half destroyed, animals were killed, many nets, boats, clothes and domestic utensils were completely spoiled. The ebb and flow int he river continued for a considerable time. </p><p>At first there was no information concerning the fate of the Tsutsumi and Nichiro canneries (it was impossible to get to them as the water had poured out over the tundra and the snow was greatly thinned out). At one plant was seen a heap of wreckage, the other was covered with masses of ice. </p><p>On April 23 two Japanese, workers of the Tsutsumi cannery, came to Berezovy Yar. They had had to flee 2.5 km from the wave, which advanced with a great noise. They were saved only thanks to the fact that the wave was held back by the deep snow. Thereafter the Japanese wandered for eight days over the flooded tundra without food or sleep until they stumbled onto the settlement. </p><p>In summer it was found out that both factories were completely destroyed. On the whole, as Troshin and Diagliev indicate, the tsunami extended along the northwest coast of the Gulf of Kamchatka from Cape Shubert to Perevoloka [an extension of the Denby sandpit, it separates Lake Nerpich&#39;e from the Gulf of Kamchatka]. In the area of First Creek the wave had the greatest height. Wreckage from the Nichiro cannery was carried up the valley of that creek. One of the cannery&#39;s cutters was thrown across a low coastal terrace about 1 km. broad and dropped on a slope at a height of about 20 m. In the valley trees were torn up by the roots over a distance of 7-8 km. </p><p>On the banks of Second Creek the destruction was on a smaller scale. Here the wave extended not more than 4.5 km from the mouth. To the northeast of First Creek, inthe area of the Tsutsumi cannery, the wave passed to the north over the tundra only 4km, and Ust&#39;-Kamchats, which is 1 km from the shore of the sea, was affected only on the southwest. Farther east towards Perevoloka the wave was still smaller. The radio station and cannery No. 1 suffered only on the side facing the sea. At Perevoloka the wave was no bigger than a storm wave; drifting timbers and sea week were thrown up on shore 50-70 m. \r\n</p><p>Intense tsunamis spread, apparently, also in a southeast direction from the center of the earthquake. Thus, a wave about 4 m high lashed Bering I. </p><p>(above from reference #413)\r\n</p><p>April 13, 1923, 1530 GMT.

An eyewitness described the wave as moving northward from a point within the middle of the north Dead Sea basin.

The associated tsunami was the most destructive of all those produced in the Mesoamerican Trench in this century, and destroyed the resort of Cuyutlan, Col. A 10 m wave caused the death of more than 75 people and more than 100 were injured. The extension of the horizontal inland flood was 1 km, and the water reached the railroad tracks. Material damages were estimated at beween 2 and 6 million pesos (3.65 pesos to the dollar). Hotels and private houses by the beach were totally destroyed. The main street lost all its cobblestones, and some people were buried in the sand. The sea avalanche rushed over the houses, invading the main street. The population ran for cover, but some persons were caught by the waves and disappeared in them, screaming in terror. Not a single house was left standing in a stretch 20 km long and 1 km wide. <p>A section of the railroad track between Cuyutlan and Manzanillo was obstructed by sand, trees and bushes dragged by the tsunami. This phenomenon hit a 25 km extension from Ventanas (Manzanillo), to Salinas de Guasango (Tecoman). In Tenancingo, the tsunami also caused some casualties. Cuyutlan was invaded by two tsunami waves of less intensity: one during the night of June 22nd, and the other shortly after nine o&#39;clock in the morning of the 23rd. That time, the water only reached the main square in the resort, approximately 500 m from the coast.

Andaman earthquake had a moment magnitude Mw 7.7 and was located at 12.1 N and 92.5 E (Bilham et al., 2005). A tsunami was triggered by this earthquake in the Bay of Bengal. Height of the tsunami was reported to be of the order of 0.75 to 1.25 meters. At the time no tidal gauge was in operation. Mathematical calculations suggest that the height could be of the order of l m. This tsunami was witnessed along the eastern coast of India. It is believed that nearly 5,000 people were killed by the tsunami on the east coast of India. Local newspapers are believed to have mistaken the deaths and damage to a storm surge, however, a search of meteorological records does not show any storm surge on that day on the Coromandel Coast (Murty, 1984). National dailies like the Times of India, which reported the quake&#39;s shaking effects, did not mention any deaths, either as a result of a storm surge or a tsunami. (reference #2771)</p><p>The most recent of the major earthquakes in the Andaman Islands preceding the 2004 rupture occurred in 1941, a year before Japanese occupation of the islands. The earthquake was described only after the Second World War Ghingran, 1953; Krishnan, 1953). Although the tsunami generated by the 1941 earthquake is stated to have caused much loss of life along the east coast of India (Murty and Rafiq, 1991), no official (or unofficial) account of the impact of the remote tsunami has been discovered. Jhingran describes the loss of low-lying western-facing forest cover on the Andamans, presumably by a tsunami, but mentions no loss of life. Eyewitness reports published informally by the Society of Andaman and Nicobar Ecology (SANE) following the 2004 earthquake add further details to the official 1941 accounts. The central watchtower of the cellular jail in Port Blair collapsed along with a hospital and other masonry structures. Eyewitnesses spoke of subsidence of Ross Island (as in the recent earthquake), requiring its abandonment in favor of the current mainland capital, Port Blair. (reference #8835)</p><p>The small tsunami results from a combination of that mechanism and of a source located under the islands themselves and in shallow water, implying a reduction in amplitude under Green&#39;s law when transitioning to a deeper basin[...]Murty and Rafiq (1991) suggested that it resulted in 5000 deaths in India. However, Ortiz and Bilham (2003) and Bilham et al. (2005) have failed to unravel any scientific or press evidence to support this assertion (in contrast, e.g., to the Car Nicobar event of 1881), casting strong doubt on its veracity: it is extremely unlikely that a 1-m tsunami would result in such a death toll. (reference #12507)</p><p>Finally, the 1941 earthquake in the Andaman often appears in lists of IOT, but we could find no direct observation of a tsunami associated with this event (e.g. Jhingran 1952, only reports \u2018\u2018there is no doubt that extensive waves\u2019\u2019 impacted the Andamans). Murty and Rafiq (1991) claim this event killed 5000 people along the west coast of India, but neither our archive search nor that of Ortiz and Bilham (2003) were able to confirm this claim. (reference #2725)</p><p>An earthquake of magnitude 8.1 occurred in the Andaman Sea at 12.9 N and 92.5 E on 26th June 1941 and a tsunami hit the east coast ofIndia. As per nonscientific/ journalistic sources the height of the tsunami was of the order of 0.75 to 1.25 m. At that time no tide gauge was in operation. (reference #8776)</p>",

The tsunami arrived in Rabaul after approximately 28 minutes, a few minutes before midday. It began with a small ebb and was followed by a\r\nseries of waves of larger amplitude. The maximum wave height from peak to trough was estimated at 5-6 m, although the tide gauge did not record that level. The period was about 30 min. This tsunami occurred during low-tide, but the maximum rise of water nearly submerged the usual high-tide mark by 1.8 m. Coastal flooding damaged boats, automobiles, and buildings. The tsunami reached a height of 18 cm and a period of 27 min as registered in the tide gauge records at Alotau (Madang, Papua New Guinea). At\r\nAnewa Bay a height of 42 cm and a period of 10 min was recorded. The tsunami caused damage on the southern coast of New Ireland where coastal villages reported destruction of houses, quays, and plantations. A plantation in Metlika, near the source region, was completely destroyed. Waves\r\npenetrated 800 m inland. Nissan Island which was close to the epicenter also sustained damage. Tsunami destruction was irregularly dispersed along the affected coastline. Some\r\nplaces escaped damage while others were heavily hit.\r\nThe tsunami was also observed in places beyond New Britain and New Ireland. The following tsunami heights were reported: 24 cm on Kwajalein, 9 cm on Ttuk, 6 cm on Wake, 12 cm on Midway, 12 cm in Honolulu, 30 cm on Kahului, 9 cm in Los Angeles, 15 cm in Crescent City, and 6 cm on Attu\r\nIsland. (reference #417)\r\n<p>Much of the quake damage was concentrated around the Cape St. George and villages and plantations adjacent to it. The villages most affected were Lamassa and Lambom. Both villages were hit by the tidal wave that swept across the tip of Cape St. George. The other villages namely - Matkamalagir sic, Bakum, Bakok sic, Morukon and Taron weren&#39;t hit by tidal wave. Much of the damage in the latter villages were caused by the tremor alone.

        "comments": "543, 40.3 N, 28 E, earthquake intensity 10.5. Many sources report a strong earthquake affecting the town of Cyzicus (Asia Minor), destroying the city. The date of occurrence is uncertain: some authors date the event in 542 B.C., others in 543 B.C. or in 544/545. According to Giudoboni, the description of anomalous sea behavior in Thrace is dated 544/545 B.C. In area of Odessos (today Varna), Dionisopolis (today Balchik) and Afrodision the sea went out of its coasts as far as 4000 steps (about 5.8 km) in the Thrace coast. Many people drowned. (ref. #4139) <p>542 (possibly 543, Sept. 6), winter. Region of the Sea of Marmara. An earthquake. Cyzicus was destroyed. In some places, the shore of Thrace was flooded for 3-4 km including Odessus, (i&#61;4). The sea returned to its normal state after many people were killed and much damage done. Waves were observed in Dionysioupolis, Aphrodesion, in the Gulf of Edremit, in Asia Minor where many towns were flooded. There exists no reliable information on the preceding earthquake, but values of its parameters are available: 40.3 N, 27.8 E, M &#61; 6.8. (ref #2130) </p><p>542 Winter. Sea of Marmara. Thracian Coasts and Gulf of Edremit. From Cedrinos we learn that in the reign of Justinianus the sea flooded the coasts of Thrace and that the cities of Odessa (Varna), Dionysioupolis, Aphrodesion and other towns in the gulf of Adramyttium were inundated. The sea in many places advanced four miles inland and after drowning many people and causing heavy damage to the land retired to its habitual places... Neither Cedrinos nor Glycas imply in any way that the inundation of the Thracian coasts was the result of an earthquake. We notice, however, that Theophanes and Cedrinos mention in this period an earthquake which devastated Kyzicos (Banderma) and damaged Constantinople. This earthquake can be easily placed in the beginning of Sept 542 AD. This inundation of Thracian and Aegean coasts shows quite clearly the characteristics of a seismic sea-wave. It does not seem improbable that the cause of this wave was in fact the earthquake at Kyzicos (Banderma). When these two events happen to be so closely spaced together. From the narrations of the writers in the Corpus Scriptorum Historiae Byzantinae on earthquake events of the period, one feels inclined to go even further and suggest the earthquake at Constantinople of 542, that of Kyzikos and the seismic sea-wave that followed belong, if not to the same earthquake, but to the activation of the Marmara region. (ref #24) </p><p>544. Black Sea. A destructive sea wave in the Black Sea flooded the coast of Thrace, inundating Odessus (now Varna), Dionysopolis (now Balchik) and Aphrodisium by advancing 4 miles inland, drowning many people before retiring. This event is mentioned by Theophanes, who places it in a.M. 6037 (Sept 544 to Aug 545), or in the 18th year of Justinian (Cedr. CS 657), which commenced in April 544. He does not mention, however, whether this event was associated with an earthquake. (ref #9116) </p><p> Tsunami observed in the Kapidag Peninsula, Erdek, Bandirma. (ref #11164) </p><p> </p><blockquote><i>Ref #11868:</i></blockquote>  <p>A large earthquake occurring offshore of the Bulgarian coast of the Black Sea, very likely produced a strong tsunami that inundated in three coastal zones, namely Odessus, today Varna; Dionysopolis, today Balchik; Aphrodisium, situated in the Thracian Peninsula at the Xeros (today Saros) Bay, Northeast Aegean Sea. It is reported that sea advanced on Thrace by 4 mi and covered the three territories. Many drowned in the waters. However, no further details available. It is puzzling how a single tsunami event was capable to inundate coastal zones in Bulgarian Black Sea and the same time Thracian coasts facing the North Aegean Sea. This tsunami event is a good example, which indicates several uncertainties that often arise from historical documentation of tsunamis.</p>",

The testimonies and letters are reported in extenso by Louat (Louat, 1988) and Loua and Baldassari (Louat and Baldassari, 1989). The oral transmission of events gives evidence even today of some areas reached by the waves. A minimal runup of 2.5 m is reported in Mou by four descendants of different families affected by the tsunami (Ephrem N., 87 y.o., Andre L., 50, Jules H., 73, and the Lossi tribal area&#39;s High Chief, Evanesie Boula, ~50).

There was a strong earthquake (1 deg N, 126.25 deg E) and tsunami on the northeast of Indonesia. </p><p>A tsunami appeared soon after the earthquake. The sea suddenly rose 2 m (1 fathom) at Manado, 3.5-4 m (2 fathoms) at Kema; the same occurred at Amurang. Thirty residential blocks (districts) were destroyed at Kema.</p><p>At Bentenan, one residential district was flooded 15 times in 2 hours. The water rose 0.5 m (2 feet) in the yard of a home on the coast during the first three waves. The Palemba River was dammed and swelled heavily on a 700 m stretch, though adjacent areas were not inundated. The tsunami began during an ebb when the sea level fell 2 m below the mean mark, and the shore was inundated to a height of 2.5 m above this mark. Thus, the amplitude of oscillations can be estimated at 9 m [2 1/4 m?].\r\n</p><p>The sea was very restless at Ternate Island, now falling, then slowly rising.</p><p>On Sangihe Island at Peta, there was a very great flooding. At Tahuna, there was a rise in water level by about 1.5 m. The water rose in about 2 minutes and fell in 3 minutes. The movement of the water, according to an eyewitness, began a minute after the earthquake and was accompanied by a noise like a strong surf. The bridge across the river at Tahuna was lifted by the flood and partially knocked off its piers. The waves recurred throughout the night until morning, at gradually increasing intervals: from 5 minutes to 30 minutes. Most of the residents of Tahuna rushed to the adjacent hills after the earthquake and spent the night there. On the 9th, many dead fish were found on Cape Tahuna. Six proas were loaded full with the fish. It was on this account that the residents thought that the cause of the earthquake was the eruption of an underwater volcano (Banda Wuhu?) in the vicinity of Sangihe Island.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #79:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>1889, Sept. 9, 1899. 2.2 N, 125.4 E.

        "comments": "On March 6, 1895, at 6:35 p.m. [local time] when anchored in the Trobriand Group off the small island of Yaga; latitude 8<sup>o</sup> 32.5&#39;S, longitude 151<sup>o</sup> 02.5&#39;E, the shock of an earthquake was felt. The ship heaved and trembled for over a minute. The motion was slight but marked, and was very like the motion imparted to the ship by the action of the screw when it is reversed and the fore part of the ship is aground. So far as I saw, the shock did not affect the surface of the sea near the vessel. <p>On our arrival at Kavatari next morning we found that the earthquake had been felt on shore at that place. It had caused the trees to sway and a cavity had been formed near the village. The cavity, a few yards in diameter and about four feet deep at its deepest part, had apparently been due to the giving way of the covering of an underground hollow.\r\n</p><p>On the following day we reached the island of Sim-Sim and learned that earthquake shocks had been felt in the evening of March 6th, and that the island had also suffered from a wave of the sea. The account given us by a native of the earthquake and the wave was this: A little after sunset they experienced a shock, then followed a loud booming sound apparently not very far off, then another shock. After this there was a lull for a short time, and then they heard the noise of the advancing wave, which almost immediately afterwards swept over the flat. The waters knocked the frail native houses down and swept portions of them, together with household goods, into the sea. <b>One little child was drowned</b>, and one man we saw that received some severe abrasions of the skin. \r\n</p><p>A native of Buna village, says that &#39;about 11 years ago (1895) the water came up in the same way but very much higher, and he gave me the <b>names of 26 people of Buna who lost their lives</b>. A report states &#39;My information indicates that it was a true earthquake-induced tidal wave or tsunami - the sea receded some distance before the wave came in. The wave traveled inland some 4 miles south to about the area of Ononda. I interviewed MacKenzie on 14.9.71. He was not able to tell me a lot except that his father was a small boy at the time, and that the <b>wave was probably about 20 ft high</b> and it had left Nixon in some thorn bushes.&#39; </p><p>When we reached Cape Vogel on March 21, we learned from the natives there that a short time back a great wave had struck the shore, apparently in Porlock Bay. News of the catastrophe had come down the coast to Cape Vogel. The natives could not give the date, but the time they gave was a little after dark, which corresponds with the time the water swept on Sim-Sim. The natives said that <b>four small villages in Porlock Bay which are close to each other were washed away and some people drowned</b>. \r\n</p><p>(above from reference #99)\r\n</p><p>Reports indicate that the tsunami was very localised and/or directional, the water receded first then returned as a 6m high tsunami at Sim-Sim yet no impact was observed on Kawa only 20km away. A \u0091great wave&#39; was reported in Porlock Bay on the Papuan Peninsula west of the Trobriand\r\nIslands where four villages were washed away, some of the villagers drowned. At Buna it is reported that 26 people drowned (Everingham, 1977). We have assumed the tsunami height there was 3 to 5m to cause the damage reported. At Simbang (near Finschhafen) the detailed sea-level observations made by missionary J. G. Pfalzer describe a typical tsunami with run-up of about 1m. (reference #11522)</p>",

A report from Haines\r\nsaid that the Davidson Glacier was moved a half\r\nmile by the shock (Alaska Daily Dispatch,\r\nSeptember 24, 1907, p. 1). Captain Nyland of the\r\nPetrel, which was four miles north of Haines,\r\nobserved a slight temporary change in water\r\nlevel, (Tarr and Martin, 1912, p. 96). The\r\nearthquake was recorded on the seismograph at\r\nSitka, and Soloviev and Go (1975, p. 216-217)\r\nestimate the magnitude to have been 5.5 based\r\non the small record there. They believe the water\r\nchange was seiche as the magnitude was small.\r\nHowever, landslides and ice falls could be\r\nassociated with small-to-moderate earthquakes.\r\nSeiche, if they are possible at all in the\r\nearthquake source region, are not usually found\r\nwith small earthquakes.\r\n<p>The report of cable disruptions by the cable ship\r\nBurtiside states that it was advised of a cable\r\ninterruption to the Sitka-Valdez cable on the\r\nmorning of October 2 and repaired a break on\r\nOctober 6 caused by &#34;submarine upheaval.&#34; &#34;It\r\nis believed that this interruption was caused by\r\na submarine upheaval as advices afterwards\r\nreceived from the Weather Bureau at Sitka show\r\nthat a seismic disturbance occurred west of that\r\nstation at the time the cable became interrupted.&#34;\r\nAs there is not another earthquake reported for\r\nthe following week this cable break is probably\r\nfor the event of September 25. The Burnside&#39;s\r\nreport that the break occurred on October 2 is\r\nprobably when they heard of the break while in\r\nValdez. \r\n</p><p>The location of the break was not given other\r\nthan 348 nautical miles from Valdez and 172\r\nnautical miles from Sitka. It was a complete\r\nseparation. This seems to put the break in the\r\nopen ocean south of Yakutat Bay.\r\n</p><p>This appears to be the first of 39 reports of cable\r\nbreaks ascribed to submarine slides and earthquakes\r\nin southeastern Alaska and the Prince\r\nWilliam Sound area. Fourteen of the breaks\r\noccurred near Wrangell and were caused by\r\nsubmarine movement from the sediments in the\r\nStikine River. Four of these were associated with\r\nearthquakes. Except for the 1949 and 1957\r\nevents, none produced reports of any wave\r\nactivity. Similarly, fourteen cable breaks\r\noccurred near Haines and Skagway. Many were\r\nassociated with the deltas from the Katzehin\r\nRiver and Skagway River. Four of these were\r\nassociated with earthquakes, and only those of\r\n1958 and 1964 had observed waves with them.\r\nTen more cable breaks were associated with\r\nValdez and the delta of the Lowe and Robe\r\nRivers. Six of these were associated with\r\nearthquakes, including those of 1908 (see\r\nfollowing event), 1925, and 1949, which were\r\nobserved (Heezen and Johnson, 1969; National\r\nArchives, Alaska Region, Record Group 342). (Ref #239)\r\n</p><p>A shock lasting 3-4 seconds was felt at Skagway, Klakuan, at the Point Sherman lighthouse in the region of Lynn Canal. Many residents woke up. The dishes rattled, lamps swayed, and the pendulums of clocks stopped. The shock was accompanied by a faint rumble. It was registered by the seismograph at Sitka. A seaquake was felt on a ship situated 7 km (4 miles) north of Haines, and a small temporary change in the water level was noticed. [These were probably seiches. Judging by the amplitude of the shocks at Sitka, its magnitude can be estimated at 5 1/2 &#43;/- 1/2] (Reference #415).</p>",

This is a relatively large magnitude offshore earthquake which was registered on the tide gauge at Lome. (reference #1214)\r\n<p>1933, May 19. ... At Accra, a town of approximately 77,000 people, 16 persons were killed and 133 were injured by the earthquake, which caused great alarm to Africans and Europeans alike. It was accompanied by a loud and sustained rumbling and by a violent shaking of the ground which lasted for fully 10 seconds. Many of those indoors,\r\nparticularly those upstairs in two-storey buildings, found it very difficult to walk, and children and invalids were knocked over. The majority of people who were indoors at the time ran outside but some Africans not knowing what was happening rushed indoors. The sea is said to have become rough and fishermen at Labadi and Teshi, who were in their canoes at the time, say that their canoes shivered and that they lost control of them for a time. Fortunately, none of the canoes was overturned. These fishermen say that immediately before the earthquake a light flashed across the sky and dropped into the sea. Other observers mentioned the occurrence of lightning and shooting stars (meteorites).\r\n</p><p>For a short period after, the main shock a faint smell was noticeable. It was described by one observer as a stale marshy smell and by another as a slightly sulphurous smell. This was probably caused by the discharge into the atmosphere of sulphuretted hydrogen from the mud in the lagoons near Accra...\r\n</p><p>Reliable evidence obtained from fishermen at sea at the time of the earthquake is not abundant, owing chiefly to the time at which the earthquake occurred. It appears, however, that the sea was not disturbed noticeably along most af the coast. Between Accra and Fete it was reported that canoes were shaken, the fishermen comparing the shake with the shivering of a very cold person. The sea\r\nremained calm. Further east, however, at Labadi and Teshi, the sea is said to have become rough and to have roared loudly for a few minutes. Fishermen were alarmed and cried out for help. The bump of the earthquake waves was felt on a few passenger and cargo ships at sea or in pont, but no\r\ndamage was done. The waters of the Sakumo and Kako lagoons are said to have been thrown up, to fall again with a splash, while water spurted from the sand vents as from a fountain. (reference #1077)</p>",

Further, the description of a mild earthquake, not widely felt, followed by a tsunami is very similar to that for the &#34;tsunami&#34; earthquakes on 25 March 1947 (q.v.). The 1947 March 25 (UT) MW7.0-7.1 MS7.2 ML5.9 earthquake (q.v.), centred about 60-70 km offshore was felt with an intensity of MM4 in Gisborne and was the maximum elsewhere along the coast, while the tsunami had maximum water level close to the shore at Gisborne port of about 1.5-1.8 m, consisted of several large waves and a number of smaller waves over several hours, the first of which arrived about 30-40 minutes after the earthquake. The 1880 tsunami would have similarly occurred close to the time of high tide (as calculated by NIWA Tide Forecaster).\r\n</p><p><b>Hence, a validity of 3 is assigned, and the epicentre and magnitude of the March 1947 earthquake are tentatively adopted.</b></p>",

Tsunamis from earthquakes along this subduction zone have caused significant inundation not only in Alaska but also coastal areas from British Columbia to California as well as Hawaii. Modeling of potential tsunami effects from earthquakes in the Pacific basin have shown that the Alaska-Aleutian trench is one of the most significant tsunami threats to the west coast of North America and the Hawaiian Islands. However, the January 23, 2018, earthquake in the Gulf of Alaska was not within the subduction zone regime, which, along with its strike-slip motion, greatly reduces the potential for generating a large tsunami.\r\n<p>A very small tsunami was generated by the January 23rd earthquake, and detected at a number of tide gauges in Alaska as well as Hawaii and along the U.S. Pacific coast to the southeast. According to initial water-level measurements from the U.S. Tsunami Warning Center website (www.tsunami.gov), the largest tsunami amplitude was recorded at 25cm in Crescent City four to five hours after the earthquake, and in the Alaska region during the first hour of the observed arrival times. There was no observed inundation or significant currents generated by this event in Alaska or other areas around the Pacific Ocean. \r\n</p><p>(all above from reference #12170)</p>",

The massive chunk of ice --called Hualcan glacier, it was around the size of four soccer fields -- tumbled into the &#39;513 lake&#39; in the Andes near Carhuaz, around 200 miles north of Lima. According to the Indeci civil defense institute, 50 homes have been destroyed. A water processing plant serving 60,000 local residents was also devastated when the wave struck on Sunday. Initially, six people were reported missing, feared dead under the debris -- but local governor Cesar Alvarez has said five of those have been found alive. Authorities evacuated mountain valleys, fearing more ice breakage after the tsunami, which are most commonly caused by earthquakes. Investigators have said the ice block from the Hualcan glacier measured 1,600 feet  by 650 feet. Patricio Vaderrama, a Peruvian glacier expert, said: &#34;The tsunami wave breached the lake&#39;s levees, which are 23m high -- meaning the wave was 23m high,&#34; or 75 feet. (reference #7015)"

No other location reported feeling an earthquake nor experiencing a tsunami on this date. However, there was a strong earthquake causing some chimney damage in Taranaki seven days previous, on 6 April, at the same time (note that this event is not yet in NZ National Earthquake Information Catalogue), and there may be some confusion. Being on the west coast of the North Island, it would not have caused a tsunami at Glenburn on the East Coast. Further, the earthquake does not appear to have been large enough to initiate seiching, nor strong enough locally to trigger a submarine landslide. \r\n</p><p>According to NIWA tide forecaster, high tide would have been about 1830 on 13 Apr 1882, ie it was mid-tide, or mean sea-level, at 4 pm rather than low water as indicated in the account. However, it is possible that the water had receded prior to the observer&#39;s noticing it.  From mean sea level to over high tide is about 1-1.2 m.  Spring tides occurred 5-8 days later, ie this is unlikely to cause confusion re the proper level of the tides. \r\n</p><p>An 6 April, when the Taranaki earthquake occurred, the time of low tide at Glenburn does not coincide with the observation either.\r\n</p><p>This event may be a tsunami, locally induced by a submarine or coastal landslide, which in turn may have been by a mild local earthquake.

In fact, everything within its course was destroyed: including twelve houses and some twenty-five outbuildings, which were entirely destroyed to their very foundations; while on the margin of the ice movement several other buildings were more or less damaged. On the west bank where the slide started, three houses were entirely destroyed, together with several outbuildings. The total loss of life as far as can be ascertained, was thirty-three persons. The rush of ice was followed by a rush of water from the river, which carried portions of the ruined buildings and the bodies of villagers inland beyond the road which is parallel to the shore; depositing the debris at an elevation of about fifty feet above the river level.

There was a multiple eruption of the Miyejin submarine volcano (31 deg 56.7 min N., 140 deg 0.5 min E.) 130 km south of Hachijo Island. The augite-hypersthene-dacite composition of the lavas determined the explosive nature of the eruptions. All the explosions were well recorded by the hydrophones of the American SOFAR system, including those on the coast of California. Some of the eruptions were observed visually from ships and airplanes by Japanese specialists. Thus, during the weak eruption of September 23 at 13h 40m, a water dome, with protuberances 600-800 m high and 2 km in diameter, arose over the volcano. No seaquake was felt , but waves 50 m long and 2 m high spread over the sea surface. During the stronger eruptions weak tsunamis were generated, 52 of which were registered by the tide gauge on Hachijo Island. The strongest of these waves were also registered by tide gauges on Jogashima Island and Cape\r\nOmae on the south coast of Japan. The travel time of the waves to Hachijo Island was about 30 minutes, the period 1.5 minutes, the height 10-90 cm. In the nature of dispersion and other parameters, the waves corresponded to theoretical Cauchy-Poisson waves from an initial impulse with a source diameter of 2 <u>&#43;</u> km. Some waves were like pulses. This was apparently due to the interference of waves bending around both sides of Aoga-shima Island, midway between the volcano and Hachijo Island. \r\n<p>The tsunami of September 26 was recorded in Hilo, in the Hawailan Islands with an amplitude of less than 0.1 m. \r\n</p><p>The ship &#34;Kiyo Maru No 5&#34; of the Japanese hydrographic service, which had come out to study the eruption, was lost in the eruption of September 24.</p>",

After a few moments the wave returned, but no damage was done.&#34;\r\n</p><p>&#34;Since that night the natives report that Tofoa is once more active.&#34;\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #11613:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>An extraordinary display of lighting was witnessed here and at Haabai on the night of August 26. It was something grand, and the thunder in Haabai, described in the official &#34;report,&#34; to which your correspondent has had access through the courtesy of A M. Campbell, Esq., as &#34;deafening&#34; and as having &#34;shaken the houses to their foundations.&#34;  The report further states that a few days later, the Island of Lifuka, upon which is situated the town of Pagai, the principal one in the Haabai Group was visited by a tidal wave, attention to which was first called by the sea suddenly receding and leaving every schooner and boat in the harbor high and dry. Fortunately the waves, as it swept back to the land, was not of a very great height, and consequently little, if any damage was done. This wave seems to have been local in its action for there was no sign of it here [Apia], nor have we any news concerning it from Vavau. Doubtless it was caused by some disturbance of the sea bottom, for it is reported by the natives that Tofua, the volcano some forty-five miles west of Lifuka has since become active, although previously it had been quiet for many years.</p>",

Added to the terrible war was the great catastrophe of the great tidal wave which overwhelmed the whole tribe while they were travelling on the beach from Colac to Waiau Beach. It was at Kaitangata Point that this tragedy occurred. (Saunders, 1934); According to Maori tradition, 1820 or thereabouts, was a year of great disturbances, earthquakes in the north and tidal waves in the south &#34;the Maories of Murihiku, both on the west and south-east coasts affirm that a great tidal wave swept over the area where Orepuki now is, and all along the western coast, and thereby many hundreds of the Ngati Mamoe tribe met their deaths by drowning. It appears that it was the usual custom for tribes to meet together at the Waiau mouth in the autumn to provide themselves with enough fish to carry them over the long winter&#34;. They were traveling along the beach track when great tidal waves rose from the ocean, and carried them out to sea, and it is believed no survivors remained to tell the story; a similar adventure is also recorded from an area beyond Fortrose. (Saunders, 1936); About 1811, a large party from Pahi&#39;s village and Colac Bay were making their way westward to gather food for the winter, when they were overwhelmed by a huge tidal wave which dashed them all against Kaitangata&#39;s cliff. Not one of them survived this disaster, and this incident took its toll on the Maori population of the area. Incidentally Kaitangata today, situated just west of Monkey island, is much diminished to what it was then, having been washed by many tides over the years since it is now hardly noticeable as a feature on the beach. (Smith, 2003); Pahia was originally a Maori pa. In the early days it was at Otatara, Colac and Pahia or the Aropaki district that the natives of the western district congregated. In and around Pahia are many evidences of the old days when a powerful Maori race lived in this district. Farmers when ploughing, found battle axes and skulls and greenstone weapons, and it must have been a period just before the landing of the whalers and sealers that the great war between the northern and southern Maories, which almost exterminated the powerful tribe, took place. Following this terrible war was the catastrophe of the great tidal wave which overwhelmed the whole tribe while they were travelling along the beach from Orepuki to the Waiau Beach. It was at Kaitangata Point that this tragedy occurred. The place is most suitably named for Kaitangata in Maori means &#34;eat a tribe&#34;. (Reece, 1984); In &#34;Saga of the Pioneers&#34; a story describing Otara as &#34;quite historical for it was on the Otara beach that there was a large M\u0101ori pa which was attacked by the northern M\u0101oris. While they were indulging in a great cannibal feast, a huge tidal wave came up from the sea and swept everything within radius away After the great storm which plainly showed the anger of the Great Spirit, the beach lay bare and all the looted treasures of greenstone, battle axes and ornaments were covered with sand washed up by the seas. Many of the M\u0101ories were engulphed and lost their lives. It was a strange fact that at this same period at the beginning of last century (1800s) this great tidal wave also swept over the Orepuki beach and a large party of M\u0101ories who were journeying to the Waiau mouth to obtain food for the winter were exterminated.&#34; (McIntosh, 1985)</p>"

Several vessels moored in the area were also swamped and left beached on land. The water reached one residence before receding and came just to the foundations of several others.\r\n<p>The full extent of the damage caused by the landslide is not yet known, but damage to property has been documented as far as a mile and a half downstream, and significant resource damage and erosion to the shoreline occurred as far as three miles downstream.\r\n</p><p>The park has issued a general safety warning due to the debris in the water, which is making navigation difficult. Boaters in the area have been advised to use extreme caution when boating from Cayuse Cove to Breezy Bay on the Spokane River. Along with ice deposits in the lake, there are now large trees, dock parts, and sediment deposits in yet unknown locations that have made safe navigation difficult. Due to uncertainty about conditions near the slide, people are also being advised to avoid approaching the site by land, since the ground will be quite unstable for some time and sinkholes and falling debris may occur.</p>\r\n<p>(above from reference #4407)</p>"

The amplitude of oscillations was about 2 m and continued to grow right up to 18:00, reaching a value of 3 m at that time, and then began to diminish more rapidly. The usual amplitude of high tides at Constitucion is 1 m 50 cm, and the amplitude of the highest high tides is no more than 2 m. The discharge of the Maule River in the summer is 700 m<sup>3</sup>/sec, and as a result sea water does not enter the river at high tide. The oscillations in level during the unusual phenomenon were thus on a scale greater even than the highest high tides, and since the period of these oscillations, was 20 minutes instead of 12 hours 25 minutes, they were accompanied by strong currents, whose rate at the pier, where there was usually no current at all, was 1 m/sec. \r\n<p>[It is possible that the date is mistaken and the description applies to the Kamchatka tsunami of Feb 4, 1923.]\r\n<br />(above from reference #415)\r\n</p><p>Reference #552 lists a meteorological cause.</p>"

While no human victims were deplored, this small tsunami resulted in significant structural damage to the local bathing house (mainly from its backflow cutting through a prominent gulley), and in the loss of light boats and poultry.\r\n<p>The timing of the tsunami can be asserted as Wednesday, August 27, 1969, around 03:30 to 04:00 SAST (01:30-02:00 GMT).\r\n</p><p>The nighttime occurrence of the wave means that there were no direct witnesses of its propagation from the beach to the community.

        "comments": "A tsunami-like sea disturbance of nonseismic origin\r\nwas observed on 7 May 2007 on the Bulgarian Black Sea\r\ncoast. The maximum wave amplitude was three meters, and\r\nthe sea oscillations lasted for several hours. The anomalous\r\nbehaviour was seen in many places of the coast of Bulgaria\r\nand was stronger in the north. Several accounts of\r\neyewitnesses as well as reports of local port authorities\r\nand three tide-gauge recordings are available and have been\r\ncollected and analysed. The tsunami could have been\r\nproduced by a submarine landslide or by atmospheric\r\npressure pulses. Here, we explore the former hypothesis,\r\ni.e., the possibility that the tsunami was induced by a\r\nlandslide that may have occurred on the shelf margin off\r\nBulgaria. By making use of numerical modelling we find\r\nthat submarine mass movements taking place within a\r\ncertain delimited source area off Bulgaria may have\r\ngenerated tsunamis compatible with the observations... The anomalous behaviour of the sea started around 9:00-9:30 am (Local Time) on 7 May 2007 and lasted with progressive attenuation for about 5 hours. Direct observations were made mostly in the two biggest towns of the coast - Balchik and Kavarna (about 13000 inhabitants each). The port authorities reported similar effects to the north, near Kaliakra cape and the village of Shabla. Slightly more to the south, the observations were documented by observers at the Varna port and the Galata oil and gas platform. The oscillations were recorded by two sea level analogue mareographs, one in Varna and one in Ahtopol (the southernmost point of the Bulgarian Black Sea coast) operated by NIGiF (Scientific Research for Geodesy and Photogrammetry, Sofia).\r\n<p>The tsunami caused only slight damage in the affected\r\nareas. In Kavarna, a 25-30 ton tourist boat was rotated\r\nviolently according to his captain and was damaged near the\r\nanchor holes and in some other parts, including the rudder.\r\nMany small fishing boats were cast onto the beach in\r\nKavarna and Balchik Marinas. Debris was deposited on\r\nthe shore. Some large tetrapodes (1.2 tons each) fell into the sea from the breakwater of the Kavarna Harbour. \r\n</p><p>(above from reference #4176)</p>"

The tsunami information bulletin referred to a 68 km deep, Mw &#61; 7.0 Solomon Islands (11 deg S, 161.1 deg E) earthquake that occurred at 09:53 UTC (11 April 2010, 11:53 p.m. Cook Islands time). The tsunami travel time from the Solomon Islands is around 6 h. In the absence of any other tsunami information and a lack of storm activity in the area at the time, it was thought that the wave that inundated the southern coast of Mangaia on the 13 April 2010 might have been related to the Solomon Islands earthquake (Aerenga Matapo, personal communication, September 2010).\r\n<p>People in the village of Tamarua, close to the south coast, heard a wave(s) strike the southern cliffs early on the morning of the 13 April (Taoi Nooroa, personal  communication, September 2010).

(reference #554)\r\n<p>2000, November 4, runup 7 m, 43 N, 127 W. Point Arguello, California. The Ballena research vessel was sunk. There are four well-defined, mature canyons of the Arguello Canyon system. Each of these canyons exhibits unique and similar head morphologies that suggest collapse structures. These heads all notch the distal edge of the continental shelf in about 100 meters depth of water. They are located\r\nnear or over the southwestern margin of the Santa Maria Basin, a major hydrocarbon basin. The EM300 bathymetric images show that all four canyons have detritus lobes that flow down canyon from the heads; these appear to represent evacuated material from beneath the collapsed heads.\r\nAlong the downslope margins of the canyons, down-dropped walls and slump material indicate sediment failures occur regularly downslope. These canyons are quite sinuous, and it appears that these bends result from mid-slope canyon wall failure. Authigenic carbonate deposits have been\r\ncollected at the heads of some of these canyons. It is speculated that the collapse heads, rilles, depressions and mounds are fluid-induced, possibly by escaping gas and fluids associated with the offshore hydrocarbon-rich Santa Maria Basin. This is possibly a landslide-generated tsunami.\r\nBernard, 2000. Validity 3. (reference #1315)</p>"

An estimation of the age of this sample, performed later, by the same method resulted in the earlier date of the eruption and of the ashfall: between 1700 and 1620 B.C., most likely, in 1640 - 1620 B.C.\r\n</p><p>...More reliable evidence that the tsunami generated by the eruption of Santorini did reach the shores of the Near East, actually retaining its destructive force, was obtained during the geological exploration carried out in the region of the Syrian city of Ugarit, which used to be the capital of the ancient North - Phoenician state. A library of clay boards filled up with cuneiform was\r\nexcavated.

Eight cities were destroyed, the worst hit--Patrae, Naupactus, Chaeronea and Coronea, which were destroyed, with loss of life.</p><p>Procopius&#39;s contemporary and only account of these events in 551 says that at this time a (series) earthquakes occurred throughout Greece, affecting both Boeotia and Achaea and the country around the Crisean Gulf, as a result of which many towns and 8 cities, which are not named, were leveled to the ground, among which were Chaeronea, Coronea, Patrae and all of Naupactuc where there was also great loss of life... It goes on to say that, at Echinus and at Scarphea in Boeotia in the Gulf between Thessaly and Boetia, there was a sudden inlux of the sea, which leveled both towns. The sea flooded the mainland for a long time, so that for a very considerable period it was possible for men to walk to the islands, which are inside this gulf, since the sea had abandoned its proper place and spread over the land as far as the mountains. When the sea returned to its proper place, fish were left on the ground.</p><p>It is important to recognize that Procopius places earthquakes in the plural, in the context of more than one earthquake in more than one place... he clearly refers to more than one, probably three, distinct earthquakes in central Greece, that is (1) a destructive shock in Boeotia that caused great loss of life in Schisma and destroyed Coronea and Chaeronea, probably damaging Corinth; (2) <strong>a destructive sea wave at Echinus and Scarpheia</strong>, which was probably associated with a second earthquake about 70 km away in the Maliakos Gulf between Thessaly and Boettia; and (3) a damaging shock more than 100 km to the west of Schisma in the Gulf of Corinth and in Achaea, which heavily damaged Nafpaktos and Patra.

The destructive earthquake embraced both coasts of the Gulf of Corinth, also. In the pleistoseismal zone, the earth opened and closed again, but part of the deformation of the Earth&#39;s surface was conserved including an upthrust system along the northern shore of the Gulf of Corinth, Patras, Nafpaktos, Corinth, Chaeronea and other towns were destroyed. There were thousands of victims, including 4,000 people in Patras. The same area as during the earthquakes on October 12, 1856, and on August 1, 1860, was shaken. In the apex of the Gulf of Maliacus, the sea suddenly rushed up the dry land and reached far inland destroying buildings in Echinos, Tarfi and in Boeotia. According to other sources the tsunami started with the drop in water level. After the water went away, fish, including rare specimens, were left stranded. The low water lasted so long that citizens had time to reach the islands located in the apex of the bay [Schmidt, 1881; Sieberg, 1932b; Ambraseys, 1961, 1962; Galanopoulos, 1960b, 1961; Ann.

Olsen (Reference #314) quotes a letter from the governor of St. Thomas in 1690 that stated, &#34;Last Sunday, which was April 6, this island has been hit by a terrible earthquake lasting one-half of a quarter-of-an-hour, so that people feared their houses would come down. Some hours after that the sea receded so much that one could walk about 9 to 10 fathoms into the sea and pick out fishes on dry land.&#34; Landslides on Nevis Peak caused the sea to withdraw from Charlestown.",

Excerpt from journal of the ship&#39;s commander: On Jan 8, 1780, on the 18th island, called Urup, there were great quakings of the earth, every day, both by day and by night. ... On June 18 [June 18 Julian date is equal to June 29 in Gregorian calendar], in the night before morning, almost at dawn, there was a great and terrible quaking of the earth, which continued for a quarter of an hour \u0085 they looked at the sea: in the distance fires flashed like lightning.  And a little while after the quake there was suddenly a loud rumbling. That was the running out to sea of a strange, swift tide. Stones which had been in the sea by the shore were left dry. And with the same noise first the water ran in from the sea in a great wave, and the whole shore, except for the bluff, was covered, and then the water, swiftly and with the same noise, returned to the sea. And the sea fell even more than before... And the water came swiftly from the sea like a wall, rising higher than all of the small shore crags by 5 or 6 sazhens, and it suddenly poured into the cove with as strong and sharp an onslaught as on the bluffs of the river. Our yurts and huts and everything that was there, to the last post, were torn from the ground and carried away up the creek into the gulch. And all of the people and their gear were carried along the gulch. Even stones which had been at the mouth of the creek were rolled out and carried away. There was an iron cannon on the bluff -- it was found about 50 sazhens away. And the gulches near the sea were filled with water to the top. The ship, the brigantine Sviataia Natalica, was carried with its anchor straight along the creek over the tundra into the gulch and was set down on dry ground near a rivulet. From the sea to the ship was 190 sazhens. And the breadth of the low ground across the gulch at the place where the ship was would be about 100 sazhen. Of the working people, they found <b>4 dead after the water went down</b>. And all that day until evening the water went back and forth, rising and falling, only less from hour to hour. And afterwards the people gathered all of the baggage that had been carried away and dried it. And after several days they went in skin boats to visit their people who had been elsewhere. They learned that the eastern and southern sides of the island had been inundated by the flood. At one place <b>eight of the natives were drowned</b>, they said. On the north side of the island there was no flood and the water did not rise at all. It is not known whether there was a rising of the water beyond where we were, on the 19th (Iturup) and 20th (Kumashir) islands. On June 28 Shabalin lent people to Kamchatka in one skin boat with the report, and I had to follow them on July 1 through the islands from the 18th. From the time of the flood up until our departure there were frequent quakes every day. On the 17th (Chirpoi), 16th (Simushir), and 15th (Ketoi) islands, also, there were frequent tremors while we were there. The sea flood which had risen on the 18th island had also come up on these islands but less. On the 14th (Ushishir) and other islands closer to Kamchatka there were no longer frequent quakes and there had been no rising of the waters.<p>Erroneously reported on the following date(s)in other publications: June 18, January 19.</p><p></p><blockquote>Reference #150</blockquote>1780, June 29. 45.3 N, 151.2 E, tsunami validity 4, magnitude 3.

At approximately 7 p.m., on 16 June 1819, Fort Sindri and masonry buildings in villages within a radius of 80 km were destroyed by a violent earthquake. A tsunami from the Arabian Sea surged across the Rann and sand vents in the region were active to a height of 2-3 m for three days, venting water and gas (Bombay Public Consultations, 1819; MacMurdo, 1835)... The fort at Anjar was destroyed, and a similar fate befell the fort at Sindri in the Rann of Kachchh. Sketches of Sindri fort before and after the earthquake collected by Lye11 (1853) are reproduced in Johnson and Kanter (1992), and a view of the decaying ruins in 1869 is reproduced in Wynne (1872). According to testimony elicited by Burnes (1833, 1835) a tsunami flooded the Rann of Kachchh within minutes of the earthquake and survivors were forced to climb to the top of the ruin where they were rescued the following morning by boat. Ballantyne writing from Jooria on the northern shore of Kachchh in June 17 relates (MacMurdo, 1835) that &#34;the whole town is a complete ruin&#34; and on June 18th describes ground fissures symptomatic of catastrophic-lateral-spreading; &#34;on examining the different rents, we found them to be of various extent from an inch to a foot in breadth; the depth however, being considerable, being 10, 15 and 20 feet.

The little brick fort of Sindri, 150 ft. square, was, he says &#34; overwhelmed at once with a tremendous inundation of water from the ocean, which spread on all sides, and in a few hours completely flooded the country, and converted the tract, which had before been hard and dry, into an inland lake, extending for sisteen miles on each side of Sindri... Of the four towers but one now remains; the inhabitants saved themselves from destruction by ascending it, and only reached the land on the following day by boats&#34;. &#34;It was soon discovered &#34;, he adds, &#34;that this was not the only alteration effected...; as the inhabitants of Sindri observed at a distance of five miles northward, a mound of earth or sand in a place where previously the soil was low and level. It extended nearly east and west about sixteen miles... The natives called this &#39;Allahband&#39; or the band of God, in allusion to its not being, like the other dams in the Indus, the work of man.&#34; (reference #516)</p>",

Destruction was greatest at Cap Haitien, a city of 10,000 inhabitants, which lost half of its population. The intensity was almost equally as high at Mole St. Nicolas, Port de Paix, Fort Liberte and Santiago de los Caballeros, all of which were destroyed with the loss of several thousands of lives. At Cap Haitien waves dashed against buildings along the quay; at Port de Paix the sea withdrew 60 m. and, upon returning, buried the city under 4 or 5 m. of water. The bed of the Yaqui River is\r\nsaid to have been suddenly elevated, driving its waters both up and down stream. The shock was severe at Santiago de Cuba and was felt throughout the length of the Sierra Maestra. The distribution of intensities and the phenomena of the sea-wave indicate that the earthquake was caused by a vertical displacement along a fault passing between Tortuga Island and St. Nicholas Peninsula.

Characterized by initial vertical oscillations, probably due to a massive down-drop of the fault blocks, the two tremendous shocks separated by an interval of 10 to 15 minutes launched immense tsunamis that propagated in all directions, the second larger than the first. The leading trough caused the ocean to recede from shores on all sides of the seismic convulsion. Produced as well, were the landslide tsunami at Guadeloupe and possible volcanic activity at St. Thomas and at Grenada. The most momentous tsunami known to have affected the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Danish West Indies at the time, it was also significant because of its impact on much of the rest of the Caribbean. Waves were reported from Jamaica to Grenada.\r\n</p><p>The 3 ships-of-war, the Susquehanna, De Soto, and Monongahela, comprised a squadron of naval vessels that brought U.S. officials to the Danish West Indies to consummate the purchase of the islands from Denmark.  The negotiations failed, due not only to the 5 deaths and damage to 2 of the 3 warships sent there, but also to growing doubt about the advisability of purchasing islands prone to such havoc as the devastations by the hurricane, the earthquake, the tsunami, and the yellow fever epidemic that followed. (A cholera epidemic rampaged the island exactly one year before.)

A strong earthquake occurred in Central Greece, preceded by shocks that started in the middle of July. It embraced the isthmus of Corinth and the shore of the Gulf of Corinth. Two vertical and several wavy horizontal movements followed the thunderous boom which lasted several tens of seconds. These movements were not sharp shocks, but a slow rising and subsiding. The earth rose upwards like a carpet blown by a storm. Shocks of extreme force seemed to follow the line from Galaxidi on the shore of the Gulf of Corinth toward Amfssa, Antikyma, Arahova, Delfi, Distomo, Doubia, Chrysos. Almost all the houses tumbled down in most of these settlements, as well as in the villages of Itea, Cassotis, Kastris, Pirnaki and others. Thus, port Itea was destroyed completely; not one house stood fast in Chrysos near the foot of Mt Pamassus, and 11 people were killed; there was serious destruction in Delfi; the badly constructed houses in Thermopyles crumbled down already at the first shock, and so on. The ground cracked in the vicinity of Thermopyles, and vapour came out of fissures up to 1.5 - 2 m in width. The shocks were strong in Athens, Lamia, Piraeus, Chalkida, not so strong in Corinth, Patras, Aiyion.

This earthquake caused minor damage in the Andaman Island Penal colony and generated a tsunami that was observed throughout the Bay of Bengal but not along the Burmese coast. The tsunami did no damage around the Bay of Bengal where tide gauges recorded a maximum amplitude of 0.8 m (Oldham, 1884). An analysis of five tide gauge records reveals that the earthquake was Mw &#61; 7.9 &#43;0.2 and occurred on an east-dipping thrust fault below and to the west of Car Nicobar, an island at 9 deg N midway between the Andaman and Nicobar islands (Ortiz and Bilham, 2003). GPS measurements at Port Blair indicate oblique convergence of the plate boundary (Paul et al., 2001). The earthquake is believed to have occurred on the interface between the Indian and Andaman Plates and the inferred mechanism of westward slip of the hanging wall slip is consistent with slip partitioning between the dipping subduction zone, and the strike-slip west Andaman fault east of Car Nicobar.</p><p>A feature of this earthquake is the inferred presence of a region of minor slip NE of the main rupture zone. This may have been a secondary secondary earthquake triggered by the mainshock. Its timing would have to have occurred within a few minutes of the mainshock for it to have produced the sea wave observed at Port Blair. Local populations were concentrated in only two islands and therefore there is no corroboration of this inferred northern region of submarine faulting which occurred between them. It is probable that offshore corals may be of use in reconstructing an extended history of earthquakes in the Andaman-Nicobar Islands. The island of Car Nicobar is believed to have been raised and tilted during the 1881 event. Deformation models that do not include this uplift result in an inappropriate estimate of the observed tsunami runup on the island (Ortiz and Bilham, 2003).</p><p>(above from reference #4084)</p><p>Epicentre in Bay of Bengal; waves recorded in Ceylon and Gangetic Delta in Bengal.

Magnitude values have ranged from 7.8 to 8.5. The rupture produced up to twenty feet of right lateral horizontal motion with the Pacific plate moving northward. Many landslides occured along the coast, from Cape Mendocino to Point Delgado. A four inch drop in water level was recorded seven to nine minutes after the earthquake on the Fort Point tide record, which returned to normal in about 15 minutes. There were several cycles of forty minute waves followed by what were probably seiches in the bay. None of these would be noticeable to an observer (Reference #237).\r\n<p>Everywhere on the high steep coast from Mendosino Cape to Cabo Delgada, on a stretch of many kilometers, slopes collapsed into the sea. On the lower coast between Shelter Cove and Point Arena, bedrocks and loose material slipped into the sea, and the water was turbid for several days after the earthquake...In the region of Bolinas Bay and to the north, the eastern flank subsided relatively 0.3-0.6 m (1-2 feet). Apparently, one of the flanks of the fault [the eastern?] subsided slightly under the water as well. After this disturbance, the tide gauge record shows oscillations with a period of about 40 minutes, which is equal to the period of the transverse seiches of San Francisco Bay (Reference #415).</p>",

This correlation seems doubtful because: a) Tsunamis are rarely, if ever, associated with quakes of such deep focus; b) the travel times indicated are too great; c) no observations were recorded at intervening places whereas other Tonga tsunamis have had easily observed effects at nearby coasts; d) the relative times of arrival and heights at the several stations are not in accord with an approach from Tonga.

Remarks from Report from District Office, Gasmata, 9 February 1920: On the night of Monday last, 2nd instant, at 9:12 pm a very severe earthquake shock passed over Gasmata. It was, according to Commonwealth Meteorological Forms, about strength 8 or 9, and lasted about 1 minute 10 seconds. Everyone rushed from their houses, and the natives were somewhat terrified. The newly re-built jetty was semi-demolished; fissures about 2 inches wide appeared in parts of the Island; many bottles of drugs and medicines in the hospital were broken; the old troops bungalow in the middle of the island has jumped forward off its studs, and broke stringers and cross-pieces. After the quake the harbour water rushed out the main entrance into the sea in a swift torrent but DID NOT RETURN, the result has been that the tides now reach about 20 to 24 inches lower than previous high-water mark. Much dead fish were left stranded on the reefs, and with an unfavourable wind the stench from same is still very strong. On the morning of the 2nd inst., a very heavy swell set in from SSW and continued all day, although no bad weather had happened around here. Whether this had anything to do with the quake I cannot say. The quake seemed to come from that direction, and seemed to pass away towards Talasea. The rumbling and trees knocking in the mountains inland could be heard for minutes afterwards. At Lindenhafen, two of the three houses (European built) collapsed like a pack of cards (which speaks well of the work put in on our bungalow, built by Pte. Burston), and Mr. Ross the Manager, had a narrow escape from injury. \r\n</p><p>For 48 hours after the main quake (which did all the damage) tremors of from 30 to 40 seconds duration happened half-hourly, and since then they have happened about six daily. Gasmata island is now joined to Abelle island - previously separated by water.\r\n</p><p>The tremors in this District before this time were practically nil, perhaps one or two per year, just faintly perceptible. The natives say that, about 20 years ago, there was a tidal wave, which much damage to life and property.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #99)</p>",

The earthquake was also characterized by the eruption of a mud volcano, a few km off the Makran coast, which are common features in western Pakistan. It led to the formation of four small islands. A large volume of gas that erupted from one of the islands, sent flames leaping &#34;hundreds of meters&#34; into the sky (Mathur, 1998).

At Pasni a small wave arrived soon after the mainshock, but according to Pendse (1948, ref#10984), who does not cite his source, the damaging tsunami did not arrive until 3.25 hours later. Pendse (1948) also describes the damaging 1.5-m wave at Karachi as having followed three earlier, smaller waves during the previous two hours. Ambraseys and Melville (1982, ref #1117) indicate that two damaging waves arrived at Pasni 90 and 120 minutes after the mainshock. Although accounts conflict to some extent, it appears that the largest tsunami wave did not arrive at Pasni until several hours following the mainshock.

A most remarkable aspect of the 1945 tsunami is that its main waves were significantly delayed (avg 2.5 h) with respect to the earthquake. (ref #11443)</p><p>Total number of casualties along the entire area of impact is estimated in the order of a couple of hundreds. <strong>Reports of several thousand casualties are exaggerated</strong> and derive from early estimations that were not confirmed.

        "comments": "At least 8 separate tsunamis, generated by submarine and subaerial landslides and ice falls, followed this magnitude 7.9 earthquake.  The epicenter was located on the northern coast of Cross Sound near Palma Bay.  Underwater cables were broken in Juneau, Skagway, and Wrangell.  A local submarine slump off Khantaak Island in Yakutat Bay caused <b>3 deaths</b> and wrecked a boat.  Lituya Bay, the site of repeated huge local tsunamis, experienced a massive landslide which generated a surge of water reaching 525 meters in height -- 400 feet higher than the Empire State Building.  2 boats were wrecked, and <b>2 deaths</b> resulted.  30 million cubic meters of soil and loose material were washed away, along with ten square km of forest.  Shellfish colonies, a cabin, and mining equipment were also destroyed by this massive surge.  Total property damage --primarily from the three lost boats -- exceeded $100,000 (Reference #239).\r\n<p>The earthquake caused numerous rock avalanches and slides. In Disenchantment Bay, a &#34;chunk&#34; weighing several tons broke off from a glacier descending to the water; waves 6 m high arose on the surface of the bay. On Khantaak Island, the sea waves resulting from a coastal section submerging under water reached a height of 5-6 m. A collapse in the mouth of the Alsek River caused a wave 1-2 m high, which spread upriver. The water level in the lower reaches dropped approximately 1 m; several hours later, the dam was breached and the shores of the river were flooded. In Glacier Bay, rocks crashed down from the steep beaches, resulting in small waves no more than 1/2-1 m (2-3 feet) high. Similar waves were observed in Dixon Harbor several minutes after the earthquake. The most catastrophic events, unique in the history of strong earthquakes, occurred in Lituya Bay, which is the T-shaped bed of an ancient glacier that has been filled in with water. The distinctive feature of the bay is the strong tidal currents at the throat, reaching 12 knots in velocity. At the time of the earthquake, about 300 million square meters of rock collapsed into Gilbert Bay from the northeast shore. The water extruded from the bay by the collapsing mass, splashed up on the opposite shore, reaching a colossal height. The movement of the water was so fast, that it uprooted a whole forest in the flood zone and stripped the bark and branches from the trees. Besides this gigantic splash, the collapse of this huge mass gave rise to a wave, which crossed the entire Lituya Bay from Gilbert Bay to the sea with a velocity of 150-200 km/hr, that is, with the speed of gravity waves, and devastated the shores of Lituya Bay. The tectonic dislocations in the source of the earthquake, and possibly the wave emerging from Lituya Bay, gave rise to a small tsunami, which was registered on remote tide gauges (Reference #415).\r\n</p><p>The main mass of the slide, as outlined on figure 16, is a prism of rock that is roughly triangular in cross section, with dimensions of 2,400 feet and 3,000 foot along tho slope, a maximum thickness of about 300 feet normal to the slope, and a center of gravity at about 2,000 foot altitude. From those dimensions and an assumed specific gravity of 2.7, the volume and weight of tho rock mass are, respectively, <b>40 million cubic yards and 90 million tons</b>. It is highly probable that this entire mass plunged into Gilbert Inlet as a unit at the time of the earthquake, although tho only known fact is that it fell between about noon on July 7 and about 10 .m on July 10.

On Attu Island, the level rose and fell 2 1/2 m (8 feet) relative to the normal position. On the southern coast of Shemya Island, the height of rise of the water was estimated at 9-10 m (30-35 feet). Here the warehouse was flooded and a part of the coastal road was washed out. Slight damage from the tsunami was reported from Amchitka Island. In Japan on the Sanriku coast, slight damage was done to the oyster beds, although the rise of water was only a few tens of a centimetre. The tsunami was registered by many tide gauges in the Pacific.  On the coasts of the USSR and Japan, the tsunami began with a tidal wave, the mean period of which was 25.5 minutes, The maximal amplitude of oscillations was observed in Japan 4-6 hours after the arrival of the first wave, regardless of the epicentral distance of the station.</p>",

        "comments": "<i><blockquote>Ref #1315</blockquote></i>1998, July 17. A magnitude Ms 7.1 earthquake occurred near the northwest coast of Papua New Guinea 850 km northwest of Port Moresby, the capitol of Papua New Guinea (PNG). The earthquake, which occurred at 6:49 P.M. local time, was followed by a series of three catastrophic tsunami waves that devastated the villages of Sissano, Warupu, Arop (1 &amp; 2) and Malol on the north coast of PNG killing at least 2,182, injuring 1,000, and displacing more than 10,000.<p>The earthquake was felt widely in PNG coastal communities. In the Aitape region, it was reportedly strong enough to make walking difficult and to knock objects over. The main shock was followed 20 min later by two moderate aftershocks that occurred so close together that they appeared to be a single event.</p><p>The three waves affected a 40-km length of coastline from the mouth of the Bliri River on the west to the town of Aitape on the east. This length of coastline was home to around 15,000 people before the tsunami. The area is predominantly tropical swamp land-a home to tribes that rely on subsistence farming and fishing and live in beach homes made of local materials. This section of coastline was particularly vulnerable because a narrow strip of land separates the ocean from Sissano Lagoon, a lagoon formed by a tsunami in 1907.</p><p>At many locations along this stretch of coastline the first wave arrived about 20 min. after the main shock (just after the first aftershocks). The trough of the first wave arrived soon after dark accompanied by loud sounds that drew curious tribesmen to the beach where they viewed the exposed sea floor. This was followed by an air blast that reportedly knocked people off their feet and a 7 to 10-meter tsunami crest. At Warupu and the Arop villages the second crest was described as riding on the back of the first and breaking over the villages, sweeping debris over the spit and washing it into the lagoon or 500 m inland from the coast. Trees were uprooted, and mature mangroves were broken off at distances of 1,300 m from the shore. Maximum wave heights reached nearly 15 m along a 20-km stretch of the lagoon area.</p><p>The villages of Arop and Warupu were entirely destroyed.<i><blockquote>Ref #11882</blockquote></i>In 1998, the official estimate of deaths resulting from the tsunami was just over 2,200. Working back from the names listed on the memorials that were erected a year later, on 17 July 1999, authorities have been able to <b>confirm 1,636 deaths</b> (written communication from Tom Ritchie). The difference between the two figures remains unexplained. A further 1,000 were treated for serious wounds (p.48).\r\n<i><blockquote>Ref #2707</blockquote></i>The death toll of the Aitape tsunami disaster has been confirmed at 2,182 as of 7 August 1998 while over 500 people are still missing. Major human damage are reported from three villages on sandbar of Sissano lagoon. Almost damage caused by the tsunami. Number of dead and missing is over 2,000. The population before the disaster was about 6,600 and the casualty reached a third of the population. Especially, over two thirds of the people were dead in Arop and Wrapu. The damage of this tsunami concentrated there. These two villages locate on a sand spit of Sissano Lagoon. Sissano Lagoon is 10 km in length, 3 km in width and 2 to 3 m in depth. It was made by the 1907 earthquake. Because the sand spit is 100 to 200 m in width and 2.5 to 3 m in height houses on this sand spit could be washed out easily by the tsunami. Its building was destroyed and only its foundation remained. The average maximum heights of the tsunami waves they crossed the Sissano sandbar was about 10 m. However, the wave height varies at different points long the sandbar and was as high as 15 m above the sea level at the former site of the Arop village. In this 1.2km long sector of the sandbar nothing was left standing now. There was a complete stripping of structures and trees.</p>",

In the rhetorical speech &#34;Rodiakos&#34; of Aristides Aelius (129-189 AD), communicated to the citizens of Rhodes, a strong tsunami caused by the earthquake is described (see passages 20-26): <i>&#34;. . . and I remember that in that fatal noon, when the calamity that happened to you started, when the sea was calm,. . . and all the earthquake force was directed against the city. . . Then the sea water retreated and the ports dried up. . . and the ports became as the dry ground. . . And everything happened at the same moment: the earthquake of the sea, the clouds, the roaring, the lamentations, the noise of the dead bodies, the ground subsidence. . . Everything had collapsed. . . &#34;. </i> In addition, the speech of Aelius makes clear that the islands of Symi (Dodecanese) and Serifos (Cyclades) were not destructed by the earthquake as claimed by Papazachos and Papazachou (1997) who apparently misunderstood passage 38 of the speech. The estimates for the year of occurrence of this earthquake and tsunami event range about seven years around 148. Papachristodoulou (1994) prefers to call it &#34;the large shock of the middle of 2nd century AD&#34;. (reference #2840)</p>",

This event is also dated July 11, which is the Julian date, and as July 22, the Gregorian date uncorrected for the now-existing\r\nInternational Date Line. This great earthquake, which ruptured at least a 600 kilometer segment of the plate boundary (extending from Kodiak Island perhaps to Unga Island or beyond), produced strong ground motion and landslides at both Kodiak and Unga Islands. Extensive loss was reported on Kodiak Island due to multiple tsunami produced by this event. Subsidence was also reported at Kodiak near the harbor. Aftershocks on Kodiak Island lasted a month or longer. Clearly there was an earthquake and tsunami at Three Saints Harbor on July 11 (Julian date).

It was impossible to remain standing on Unga and Kodiak Islands; on Unga Island, &#34;many mountains crumbled.&#34; The subsequent shocks, at least two or three or more per day, were felt for at least a month on Kodiak Island. The coast of the island may have subsided somewhat. &#34;Before we had come to our &#34;senses after the tremor, a flood came in from the sea.&#34;  In Three Prelates Harbor at Kodiak Island, several buildings were washed away, and the soil was partially washed out and littered; two large waves were observed. On Unga Island, the water rose 115 m (50 fathoms) [?], and many Aleutians died. &#34;The water passed over Sanak Island in strong, uncommon roller; &#34;some swine brought to the island drowned. The tsunami was also observed at Pavlov village, but with considerably less force. There were no noticeable waves on the northern side of Unimak Island.

This would be approximately 16 Lat, -86 Lon. Lander et al.

Reportedly the sailors described the shock as crashing against the rocks. An earth movement began at the river mouth, and advanced, slowly wiping out massive amounts of land 84 m north to south, and ruining a large house. The shaking reportedly lasted many hours.

Detailed accounts of the phenomenon are listed below. </p><p>Through persons who have come from the Kuril, from the islands and from Cape Lopatka, also from Avacha, I have learned that there was a great earth tremor there, which began at all of the places mentioned at the same time. </p><p>On the first of the Kurile Islands, called Sumshchu [Shumehu], the earthquake was of the following form. On October 17 [October 6 Julian calendar] at 3 o&#39;clock in the night the earth shook so sharply at first that many huts fell down. This quake came in waves from the SSE, and as soon as the shaking ceased suddenly came from the sea with great noise about 3 sazhens [6 m] of water, which immediately went out again far to sea. </p><p>With the recession of the water the earth shook again, only very slightly, and afterwards the water again came from the sea to the same place where it had been the first time. After a quarter of an hour the waters of the sea for the third time, with a very great noise, came up to about 10 sazhens higher than the previous places, which carried away many native dwellings. This water ran off again into the sea and throughout two days rose and fell. </p><p>Around Lopatka and at Avacha the quake began at the same date and hour, only it was slight the first time, but the second and third times it was as on the island, very sharp, so that many huts fell down. After the third time, the water came from the sea with a great noise, about 15 sazhens high, covering - all of the low places round about and also the lower hills. It carried away many native dwellings, baggage, food, and skin boats and caused no little loss to the Russians who were there at the time, who, leaving all of their baggage in the yurts, had to flee to high ground and there seek to save themselves. Between the rivers Viliuchik and the Avacha cove a small new cove was made. The place where the cove was formed was a meadow with kliukva and shiksha berries and two huts stood there in which the natives had put food. At the time of the great water the huts were carried away with the ground and two native women and a man who were in the huts were drowned. </p><p>An excerpt from a journal provide grounds for supposing that in 1737 strong tsunamis also lashed the Komandorsky Islands: </p><p>The greatest changes on the island [Bering] may have resulted from earthquakes and high sea tides. Indubitable signs of powerful inundations were driftwood, bones of whales, and whole skeletons of sea cows which had been carried high up on the shores or far into ravines toward the center of the island. By the age of the drift logs I could conclude quite confidently that in the inundation of 1738 [an obvious error; 1737 is meant] on the coasts of Kamchatka and the Kurile Islands, the waters also lashed Bering Island to a height greater than 30 sazhene [64 m]</p><p>(above from reference #413) </p><p>Reference #11787 states the following regarding Georg W. Steller account included in reference #413: &#34;The abbreviation f or ft instead of the word foot (feet), which was interpreted by the clerks as fathom.&#34; &#34;Finally, in the Russian translation of the fair copy, fathom (1.83 m) was replaced by Russian fathom, or sazhen (2.13 m), a unit of length formerly used in Russia, and the already six times overestimated tsunami height (30 fathoms &#61; 54.9 m) was increased by another nine meters.&#34; &#34;Reality the height of the 1737 tsunami runup on Bering Island was hardly more than 3-4 m; only in individual narrow valleys of the rivers flowing into small and shallow bays could it have reached 8-10 m.&#34;</p>",

The port of Omoa was almost totally destroyed. Many cracks appeared in the walls of the ancient Spanish fortress. The ground cracked in a radius of 50 km (12 leagues) in the vicinity of the city and on the coast between the Rio Tinto and Ulua Rivers. The town of San Jose was also destroyed, and Beliz suffered damage. Weak tremors lasting 30 seconds were felt at Guatemala. Underground shocks lasted all the night of the 4th-5th. Then for a week more than a hundred were counted, and they lasted at least until the 27th. The Indian tribes of Honduras long remembered this earthquake. At Omoa, the sea fell and rose to a height of 5 m in still weather; it reached the foot of the fortress and added to the destruction begun by the earthquake. A similar phenomenon was observed on the shore of Criba lagoon. (reference #415)\r\n<p>August 9, 1856, 16 N, 88 W, magnitude 7.5. Earthquakes (from August 4 to 14) damaged villages, on the Honduras coast from the banks of the Rio Tinto to Rio Ulna and Omoa, Livingston, Santo Tomas, Belize, Jamaica, and Guatemala City. Tsunami effects included the following: At Omoa, the sea fell and rose 5 m reaching the base of the fortress and adding to the earthquake damage. During violent trembling at the mouth of Rio Patuca, the water receded from the 8 km broad Criba lagoon toward the sea, leaving the bottom dry. The waters returned from every direction, rose in a column then fell and advanced toward the land. The tsunami carried whole trees, branches, and stones. Natives reported that water swept into the interior about 24 km. The tsunami affected several towns, including Cortez, Atlantida, and Trujillo. There were reports of rivers changing directions, probably due to bores. (reference #537)\r\n</p><p>August 4, 1856, 17:00 Local time. Magnitude 7-8. Based on the descriptions of this earthquake, you could be a high magnitude event with epicentral region in the Cayman Trench, between Honduras and Jamaica. According to the description of Montessus (1888) on the coast of Honduras a single jolt caused major damage in the port of Omoa, opening many cracks in the walls of an old Spanish citadel and on the ground in an area about 12 miles ( 50 km) radius between the deltas of the rivers Tinto and Ulua. The small town of San Jose, also was ruined. The sea withdrew and increase their return considerably damages. Montessus notes that this is a rare example of a tsunami in Central America; apparently came up with a seiche in the lagoon Sieve, according Boscowitz (1885), who collected testimonies from destruction of several towns, rivers that changed direction and many victims. (reference #124)\r\n</p><p>August 4, 1856, magnitude 7-8, Omoa, Honduras, Gulf of Honduras. This tsunami has been mistakenly associated with the Pacific coast of Honduras in Heck (reference #132). Omoa is a town on the Atlantic coast of Honduras. The tsunami affected several towns all along the Atlantic coast of that country, like Cortez, Atlantida, Trujillo, and Criba Lagoon. There are accounts of the complete ruin of Omoa, destruction of entire villages and rivers changing direction. This seems to be one of the largest tsunamis to have affected the Atlantic coast of Central America. (references #273 and 82)\r\n</p><p>August 4, 1856. El Salvador to Nicaragua.

Dr. Okal continued his presentation, agreeing that the tsunami that hit Omoa in 1856 was almost certainly from an earthquake-triggered landslide. (reference #12024)</p>",

(reference #10497)\r\n<p>A powerful magnitude 8.0 earthquake off the Solomon Islands generated a tsunami of up to 5 feet that killed at least 5 people, a hospital official says, while the death toll is feared to rise as officials inspect dozens of damaged homes...  Solomons officials reported two 1.5-meter (4 foot, 11 inch) waves hit the western side of Santa Cruz Island, damaging between 70 and 80 homes and properties, said George Herming, a spokesman for the prime minister. Many villagers of the South Pacific island chain had headed to higher ground as a precaution, Herming said. Dozens of aftershocks stronger than magnitude 5 followed the quake. In Honiara, the warnings prompted residents to flee for higher ground... Four villages on Santa Cruz were impacted by the waves, with two facing severe damage, Lansley said. Other areas of the Solomons did not appear to have been seriously affected. (reference #10441)\r\n</p><p>The sea surge following the earthquake cut water and electricity and forced about 4,000 people, including 20 World Vision staff members, to move to central Lata, about 150 meters above sea level, the aid agency said in an e-mailed statement. Government officials confirmed four people were killed and some may be missing, World Vision said. (reference #10442)\r\n</p><p>A multi-disciplinary international tsunami survey team (ITST) was deployed within days of the event to document flow depths, runup heights, inundation distances, sediment and coral boulder depositions, land level changes, damage patterns at various scales, performance of the man-made infrastructure and impact on the natural environment. The 19 to 23 February 2013 ITST covered 30 locations on 4 Islands: Ndendo (Santa Cruz), Tomotu Noi (Lord Howe), Nea Tomotu (Trevanion, Malo) and Tinakula. The tsunami impact peaked at Manoputi on Ndendo&#39;s densely populated west coast with maximum tsunami height exceeding 11 m and local flow depths above ground exceeding 7 m. A fast tide-like positive amplitude of 1 m was recorded at Lata wharf inside Graciosa Bay on Ndendo Island and misleadingly reported in the media as representative tsunami height. The stark contrast between the field observations on exposed coastlines and the Lata tide gauge recording highlights the importance of rapid tsunami reconnaissance surveys. Inundation distance and damage more than 500 m inland were recorded at Lata airport on Ndendo Island. Landslides were observed on volcanic Tinakula Island and on Ndendo Island.

The eruption was accompanied at different stages by oscillations of the water level in the bay.\r\n</p><p>The first strong earthquake struck on May 28 at about 13:20.\r\n</p><p>At about 14:00, the water in Rabaul Harbor quietly retreated 90 m from shore and then returned to its usual boundary. On Raluan Is, the water also retreated slowly, then flooded the shore to 140 m beyond the high high tideline, after which it returned to its usual mark, leaving many fish on shore. In Keravia Bay, at about 13:30, the water flooded a road, rising 1 1/2-2 m above the usual level.\r\n</p><p>On May 29, at about 5:30, a new shock was felt at Rabaul.\r\n</p><p>Between 8:00 and 9:00, an elevation of Kaluan Is was observed.\r\n</p><p>At 11:00, it was noticed that the reef south of Matupi Is had become exposed. This had never happened before.\r\n</p><p>At 13:10 the water off the west coast of Raluan Is became turbid and rough. At about the same time, the reef here dried up; the reef was hidden under water at 13:15, but it came to the surface again at 13:20. During the day, many residents collected fish on the reefs, and about 20 of these people died during the eruption.\r\n</p><p>The eruption of the volcano began at 16:15. The island and the adjacent sections of bottom began to rise quickly; the little islands in the passage began to grow and merge, and soon a broad isthmus formed between the island and the mainland. Then the volcano exploded, and a black pillar of ash and steam 9 m wide and 12 m high rose into the air. The column grew with each subsequent explosion, and reached a height of 3 km. Masses of flames the size of a room or smaller flew up to a height of 1.5 km and then fell to the earth or into the water with A deafening noise. There were no lava flows. The eruption of the Tawurwur Volcano began on May 30, after 13:00. The eruption lasted until the morning of the following day; about 2,300,000 cubic m of material was ejected. It also settled to the northwest of the volcano, that is, in the region of Rabaul, where the layer of ash was several cm thick...\r\n</p><p>During the first explosions of the Raluan Volcano, the underground shocks for the most part stopped. The water near Raluan Is was markedly agitated. At Rabaul, the water retreated 45 m several times, returned to the high high tide mark, and retreated again. Then the eruption was almost continuous for 3 hrs, but there were no noticeable oscillations in level.\r\n</p><p>Beginning at 19:00, the eruption began to pulsate, and periods of explosions began to alternate with periods of relative calm. It was precisely, during such a period of calm and before 21:00, that is, before the lip of the new crater of the volcano had completely risen above the water, that considerable oscillations in level were observed in the harbor. Four to five minutes passed between the rise and fall of the water. The amplitude of at least three of the waves was 2-2.5 m above and below the mean water level. A schooner was run aground by the wave onto a small pier and then dragged to the depths of the bay together with the pier. Several boats ran aground, and one or two sank. Subsequently, the oscillations apparently diminished, but their range was still 1/2 m early in the morning on the 30th. \r\n</p><p>During the eruption, <b>more than 500 people perished, including those who drowned</b>. \r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #1412:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>1937, May 29.

        "comments": "1821, May. In the year 1821, I was a midshipman in his majesty&#39;s ship Vigo, guard-ship at St. Helena, bearing the flag of Rear-Admiral Lambert, and commanded by Cap. Thomas Brown, during the latter period of Napoleon&#39;s exile. I had charge of an excellent establishment on shore, called the stockyard, for keeping a supply of fat cattle for the squadron after its arrival from the Cape, lank and lean. My party of men always slept on board, landing the next morning at daylight. It was in the early part of May, a month rendered remarkable by the death of the great chieftain, which took place on the 5th day, that we were pulling in as usual the launch, with several working parties on board, but observing that the surf was too violent for the large boat filled with men, to attempt a landing, we tried to accomplish it by a few at a time, in the jolly boat. A small number, including myself, got on shore in this manner. Shortly after I was engaged in conversation with an officer of the Hon. Company&#39;s ship Ganges, surrounded by native women, some children, and Lascars, when I felt myself forcibly pulled by the arm, and heard a person exclaim--&#34;Look at the horizon, run, save yourself, we shall all be lost!&#34; I did look, and the sight I shall never cease to remember, it was so frightfully grand. On the horizon, from the north-west, appeared an immense undulation, or swell, resembling a bank of water rolling majestically in, directly in the wind&#39;s eye. Whether it was my anxiety for the boats, or that astonishment had paralyzed me, I cannot tell, but I felt riveted to the spot alone, and before I could attempt to save myself, as others did, by climbing the rocks I was whirled along with the rapidity of lightning, in the midst of this dark wave.\r\n<p>&#34;Almost in an instant I experienced a violent shock, which stunned me for a few moments; on recovering the perfect use of my senses, I found myself in the armourer&#39;s cave, with the forge lying across my thigh. To this circumstance I must draw attention, as, by its weight keeping me from going into the sea as the water receded, and from being dashed against the rocks, to it I owe my preservation. Near me were lying two Lascars, one was split up the middle, the other&#39;s skull was beat to pieces--<b>both were dead</b>. Fearing a return of the surf, as the sea usually runs in quickly twice, and then comes with redoubled violence, I made the best use of my lungs; the carpenter fortunately heard my cries, and rescued me. My clothes were torn to shreds, my ears, eyes, and nose, filled with ashes and blood; but with the exception of a few contusions, and lacerated hands, I was otherwise unhurt. <b>One woman was drowned</b>, and several men and children were picked up by the boats.\r\n</p><p>&#34;This first swell that I have mentioned was the prelude to a gigantic surf, which lasted three days. This phenomenon (as nothing like it had ever taken place in the memory of the oldest inhabitants) was attributed to an <b>earthquake</b>. We had only telegraphic communication with the ship while it lasted. The fortifications were much injured in front of St. James Town; huge rocks were torn up and tossed into our little bathing place to the left of the landing; the guard-house was abandoned the sea reaching the upper windows; the ships rode with sails aback, to keep them astern of their anchors; and, while it lasted, to see the mass of water burst upon the cliffs, as if to shake the island from its foundation, was the grandest sight I ever beheld.&#34;</p><p>(above from reference #4222)</p>",

The Vanuatu Meteorology and Geohazards Department reported a magnitude of Ms 6.0 for the event and at a shallow depth of 10.0 km. No tsunami advisory or warning was issued for this event since the earthquake magnitude is below the threshold of magnitude 7.5 as per the Vanuatu Meteorology and Geohazards Forecast Section Standard Operating Procedures. Thus, no warning was issued for this event. It is the third known back-arc event that has generated a local tsunami; others being the 1999 Baie Martelli event and the 2012 Southeast Erromango event. A local tsunami struck the northern part of Paama and possibly Lopevi and Southeast Ambrym. Sea water receding c. 8 - 10 minutes after mainshock (eyewitnesses at Cave beach, Liro Nessa). Cobbles rattles (sea water receding) then soon after roaring sound. Most people in the village heard roaring sound. The tsunami event involves 3 waves (eyewitnesses); the first after c. 10-12 minutes after mainshock, the second wave is much bigger than first wave after c. 8-10 minutes after 1st wave and the last wave after c. 10 minutes later. The odd hour and tidal condition has much effect on tsunami impact. The tsunami struck at an abnormally low tide condition thus having huge impact on runups and inundation distances. Some preliminary observations of runup heights and inundation distances were made for coastlines of north and northwest Paama [Figure 13]. Runup heights of up to at least c. 8.0 m (inferred above low tide level at time of tsunami attack) and a maximum inundation distance of c. 150 m (inferred from low water level at time of tsunami attack). In some localities cobbles/boulders and beach sea oaks help protect the coastline. (reference #12086)\r\n</p><p>Tsunami runup heights, inundation heights and distances are high on the Northwest of the island, from Tavie to Liro Nessa. A tsunami flow depth of up to 2.0 m and a runup height of at least 6.0 m were measured [Figure 8]. Inundation distances of up to 120 m were observed on Northwest Paama. The tsunami struck at a time of abnormally very low tide conditions; lowest tide for the month of February 2015. (reference 12087)</p>",

Associated with these landslides, tsunamis occurred. Here two specific tsunamis (Feb. 5, 1663 and Oct. 20, 1870) were reconstructed based on the scanty information available. Examination has been made of some of the optical phenomenon that were described in connection with the occurrence of tsunamis. (reference #11927)\r\n<p>Assuming that it would take more than 200 years, our recent investigation of the cliffs surrounding the Cap Trinity in 2011 provide some hints as to where it may have taken place as shown in Figure 7. The area shown by the dashed line is the only one that would be close to what has been described above. We estimate that the maximum volume of this rockfall would be about 20 000 m3. We can see that there are many other scars left of rockfalls of unknown origin. This rockslide must have triggered a tsunami (Murty and Durvasula 1977) in a context illustrated in Figure 2d.

However, for this earthquake, PTWC initially estimated it at a smaller magnitude, so they issued an information statement instead. The information statement said there was no tsunami threat from the earthquake. Later analysis did boost the magnitude to 6.9, but by that time PTWC already had sea level measurements and knew there was no tsunami threat and didn&#39;t have to upgrade to a warning level at that point. There was no threat of a tsunami, but a small tsunami was generated. McCreery said it you were at the coast, you would have seen the water level slowly go up and down. The wave was a little over a foot above normal sea level at Kapoho, where PTWC have the closest gauge to where the earthquake happened. (reference #12124)\r\n<p>On 4 May 2018, early in the 2018 Kilauea volcanic eruption sequence, an Mw 6.9 earthquake ruptured the south flank of Hawaii Island. The event involved seaward sliding of a wedge of the island offshore of the East Rift Zone, likely on the contact surface between the island and the Pacific Ocean seafloor. The resulting motion generated a modest tsunami that arrived on the shores of the major Hawaiian Islands in less than an hour. (reference #12263)</p>",

The waves occurred for at least 2 hours and possibly for 8-10 hours, and were likened to the effects of the 1868 tsunami. Some attributed the unusual conditions to a heavy southerly sea setting in at the heads. Although the account of waves in Wellington Harbour were recorded in newspapers in Hawke&#39;s Bay, Dunedin, and Auckland none reported any effects locally. \r\n</p><p>There are no large earthquakes, or tsunami events, in ITDB or NGDC for this date. Further there are no earthquakes known to have been felt in NZ on or just before this data. It is relevant to note here that the August 1868 tsunami from Peru had a significant impact in New Zealand and following its occurrence, people were particularly observing the sea and more than usually sensitive to its behaviour and to the potential of earthquakes to cause tsunami. The flurry of &#34;tsunami&#34; reports in the 3 years following the 1868 event probably reflects this. \r\n</p><p>Tsunami seems unlikely, and it is possible that swell in Cook Strait could have caused the unusual conditions.

Speaking to Tasnim on Tuesday morning, Mohammad Hassan Basti, a deputy to governor of Iran&#39;s southern province of Bushehr, said the body of an eight-year-old boy was retrieved from the pier of Dayyer on Monday evening. He was the second victim among a total of six people lost in the deadly sea storm and subsequent flooding that hit Dayyer on Sunday, he noted. According to Basti, 22 people have been wounded in the incident, 80 dwellings have been destroyed, urban infrastructure has been damaged, and some 200 boats have been wrecked in the natural disaster. Head of Bushehr&#39;s Persian Gulf Oceanography Centre Ehsan Abedi had announced that the reason behind the giant waves and the sea overflow was a natural phenomenon called Seiche, saying it occurs when strong winds push water and cause water levels to drop at one end and rise at the other.\r\n</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #11970:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>On 19 March 2017, a series of waves from the Persian Gulf inundated significant parts of the Port of Dayyer on the southern coastlines of Iran (Fig. 1), some time between 8:00 and 8:20 AM local time (4:30-4:50 GMT). It resulted in one death and five people missing, and reportedly capsized about 300 boats and caused ~$10 million of damage. According to Iranian state media, water progressed as far as ~1 km in land and video footage recorded by local individuals or seasonal travelers reveals surges of up to  2 m in a relatively calm, cloudy morning, even though a significant thunderstorm had occurred a few hours earlier. Local news outlets place the largest extent of destruction at Seyyed-Safa, a neighborhood close to the cruise port. \r\n</p><p>In summary, neither geological nor atmospheric sources can perfectly explain the distribution of amplitudes as obtained in our field survey. While we prefer the meteorological model, we suggest that its remaining misfits may be due to imprecisions in small-scale bathymetry and that future studies of the 19 March 2017 tsunami would warrant the use of a better bathymetry model for the region.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #12474:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>The waves affected about 40 km of the coastline, causing five deaths and injuring 20 people. Local authorities reported damage to ~300 fishing and recreational boats and 85 coastal properties.\r\n</p><p>The 2017 Dayyer event is the first known example of recorded destructive waves in the Persian Gulf, which caused severe damage and killed people.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #12544:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>The event was found to be very local; maximum trough-to-crest wave heights were 1.97 m at Dayyer and 2.34 m at Asaluyeh (both in Iran), near-field cities located * 80 km from each other; the dominant wave periods were 15-20 min.

A prehistoric artifact from Kodiak Island appears to be a representation of an erupting volcano and a tsunami. The prehistoric wooden box panel, collected during archeological excavations at the Alutiiq village site of Karluk on Kodiak Island, is currently on loan from the collection of Koniag, Inc. to the Alutiiq Museum and Archaeological Repository in Kodiak. The box panel, measuring 8 by 17 cm, was recovered approximately 150 cm below the surface at the Karluk archeological site on Kodiak Island. Although the box panel has not been directly radiocarbon dated, it is associated with &#34;house floor three&#34; described at the Karluk One site. Radiocarbon dates obtained during excavation at the Karluk site suggest this stratigraphic level dates to ca. 1550 AD. (Jordan and Knecht, 1988). The West Island debris avalanche and tsunami have been radiocarbon dated to ca. 1540 \u00b1110 AD. (Siebert et al., 1989), and so are indistinguishable in age from the artifact found at Karluk.

The estimated 200 million metric tons of rock spilled onto the toe of Tyndall Glacier and into Taan Fjord, in Icy Bay, Alaska. This landslide produced a tsunami that was recorded at two NOS tide gages monitored by the National Tsunami Warning Center (NTWC). (reference #11514)\r\n<p>An approximately 100-m high landslide generated tsunami flooded the coastline of Taan Fiord in SW Alaska on October 17, 2015. Inundation reached 190 m at its highest point, and exceeded 50 m along over 10 km of coastline. Within the area of inundation, several alluvial fans provided both a source and depositional setting for sediment transported by the tsunami, and each fan is blanketed by tens of cm to meters of sediment. During a month of fieldwork in spring and summer of 2016, we sampled and documented these deposits. Where the wave was largest near the tsunami source, the deposit has two distinct layers: A) a basal layer with very poorly sorted sediment ranging from sand to boulders and B) an overlying layer composed of relatively well sorted cobbles and boulders where interstitial spaces are open except at the base of this layer, where they are packed with sand. Flattened vegetation at the base of layer A indicates the lower deposit formed during inrush. Channeling and small fan-like features in layer B suggest it formed during tsunami return flow. Farther towards the mouth of the fjord, where the tsunami was only a fraction of the initial height, two fans preserve a similar poorly sorted basal layer that was in many places overlain with boulders and/or sand. The thickness of the deposit and its consistency across multiple fans along the fjord suggest both that similar deposits could be indicators of paleo landslide-generated tsunamis, and that deposit stratigraphy from these kinds of events may record useful information about a tsunami&#39;s size and character. (reference #11717)\r\n</p><p>On 17 October 2015, an estimated 60 \u00d7 106m3 rockmass (Haeussler et al., 2017; Higman et al., submitted for publication) detached from as high as ~850 m above sea level at the terminus of Tyndall Glacier (Figs. 1, 3), a site of previous landsliding (Meigs et al., 2006). Approximately 90% of the mass entered directly into the fjord, creating a tsunami with runup of up to 192 m (Higman et al., submitted for publication). Some debris re-emerged from the fjord on the opposite shore of Taan Fiord and on the eastern moraine, where it formed hummocky deposits typical of large landslides. Such re-emergence of debris onto land after travel throughwater has, to our knowledge, not been described before. A small portion of the landslide debris (~3%) slid onto Tyndall Glacier and a larger slide block remained within the source area (~7%). (reference #12007)\r\n</p><p>Glacial retreat in recent decades has exposed unstable slopes and allowed deep water to extend beneath some of those slopes. Slope failure at the terminus of Tyndall Glacier on 17 October 2015 sent 180 million tons of rock into Taan Fiord, Alaska. The resulting tsunami reached elevations as high as 193m, one of the highest tsunami runups ever documented worldwide. (reference #12261)</p>"

There was a multiple eruption of the Miyejin submarine volcano (31 deg 56.7 min N., 140 deg 0.5 min E.) 130 km south of Hachijo Island. The augite-hypersthene-dacite composition of the lavas determined the explosive nature of the eruptions. All the explosions were well recorded by the hydrophones of the American SOFAR system, including those on the coast of California. Some of the eruptions were observed visually from ships and airplanes by Japanese specialists. Thus, during the weak eruption of September 23 at 13h 40m, a water dome, with protuberances 600-800 m high and 2 km in diameter, arose over the volcano. No seaquake was felt , but waves 50 m long and 2 m high spread over the sea surface. During the stronger eruptions weak tsunamis were generated, 52 of which were registered by the tide gauge on Hachijo Island. The strongest of these waves were also registered by tide gauges on Jogashima Island and Cape\r\nOmae on the south coast of Japan. The travel time of the waves to Hachijo Island was about 30 minutes, the period 1.5 minutes, the height 10-90 cm. In the nature of dispersion and other parameters, the waves corresponded to theoretical Cauchy-Poisson waves from an initial impulse with a source diameter of 2 <u>&#43;</u> km. Some waves were like pulses. This was apparently due to the interference of waves bending around both sides of Aoga-shima Island, midway between the volcano and Hachijo Island. \r\n<p>The tsunami of September 26 was recorded in Hilo, in the Hawailan Islands with an amplitude of less than 0.1 m. \r\n</p><p>The ship &#34;Kiyo Maru No 5&#34; of the Japanese hydrographic service, which had come out to study the eruption, was lost in the eruption of September 24.</p>",

The waves damaged many houses, but it was uncertain how many people were killed. The examination of all earthquakes in the SCS during the period from 1880 to 1920 shows no earthquake that could generate significant tsunami at the Vietnamese coast.

There was a multiple eruption of the Miyejin submarine volcano (31 deg 56.7 min N., 140 deg 0.5 min E.) 130 km south of Hachijo Island. The augite-hypersthene-dacite composition of the lavas determined the explosive nature of the eruptions. All the explosions were well recorded by the hydrophones of the American SOFAR system, including those on the coast of California. Some of the eruptions were observed visually from ships and airplanes by Japanese specialists. Thus, during the weak eruption of September 23 at 13h 40m, a water dome, with protuberances 600-800 m high and 2 km in diameter, arose over the volcano. No seaquake was felt , but waves 50 m long and 2 m high spread over the sea surface. During the stronger eruptions weak tsunamis were generated, 52 of which were registered by the tide gauge on Hachijo Island. The strongest of these waves were also registered by tide gauges on Jogashima Island and Cape\r\nOmae on the south coast of Japan. The travel time of the waves to Hachijo Island was about 30 minutes, the period 1.5 minutes, the height 10-90 cm. In the nature of dispersion and other parameters, the waves corresponded to theoretical Cauchy-Poisson waves from an initial impulse with a source diameter of 2 <u>&#43;</u> km. Some waves were like pulses. This was apparently due to the interference of waves bending around both sides of Aoga-shima Island, midway between the volcano and Hachijo Island. \r\n</p><p>The ship &#34;Kiyo Maru No 5&#34; of the Japanese hydrographic service, which had come out to study the eruption, was lost in the eruption of September 24.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #4715:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>On March 9, 1953 there was a great explosion about 60 knots South of Aogashima according to the crew of the Hachijo fisheries vessel Zensei Maru (6.5 tons), and on the following morning (10th), it is reported that for a period of 30-40 minute the explosion smoke could be seen rising. At 7:30 am on March 11, 1953, tsunamis having a height of 6 meters came upon Hachijo-jima about 13 times. At 7:26 minutes and 26 seconds, the Central Meteorological Observatory recorded slight earthquake which is estimated to agree with the time of the explosion of Myojin-sho.</p>",

Many tourists came to see the sight. One family was on the Hoopuloa wharf to get a canoe to see the flow better. Suddenly, the sea receded, exposing the bay floor. The waters soon returned as a 4.3-m wave washing the man, his wife, and one son off their feet. One son tried in vain to save the family auto and was swept into a wharf shed where he held onto some beams. The man was washed about 100 m to sea, but managed to get back. His wife was carried about 400 m to sea, but was rescued by two Hawaiians who swam to a still floating canoe to reach her. The man estimated that there were 10 waves. An 18.000-liter water tank was destroyed. At Keauhou the wave height was about 2.4 m and about 0.9 m at Kailua. There was not an accompanying earthquake nor could the velocity of the lava flow generate a tsunami. A possible explanation would be the sudden collapse of the 1.5-day accumulations of lava at or beyond the shoreline.&#34; (Reference #236)\r\n<p>1919, Septetmber-October. On September 26, the Mauna Loa volcano, which had been dormant since June 1916, revived. A thick flow of lava issued from this lower crater. Less than 24 hours later, it filled up all irregularities of the relief, drove a road through the forest and reached the sea side approximately 28 km (15 miles) from the crater. For 10 days, the flow poured into the water, sometimes generating local tidal waves. On October 2nd, one family was washed into the water and was almost lost. Then the eruption began to subside, although volcanic activity was still noticeable on October 23 (Reference #415).</p>",

This stability can be disrupted, leading to failure, by events or conditions that depart significantly from ambient conditions, Landslides, slumps and rock falls are often the secondary effects of earthquakes. [Rabinovich at al., 20031.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAccording to Johns et al., [ 19851, a slide event was believed to have taken place on October 17, 1974,\r\nbut its evidence was only circumstantial. A sea-surface wave reached approximately 2.4 m high, it was observed in the head of the inlet at 11:05 A.M. (LT), shortly after extreme low tide. The location of the seafloor sediment movement that might have caused this smaller wave was not determined. It is possible, however, that this event was related to the formation of a chute on the delta front/sidewall on the eastern side of the inlet. At this location, there was a chute that originated in a steeply sloping area at the intersection of the delta front, the inlet sidewall, and a distal part of a small fan delta near Kitimat Village.</p>"

A chain of destructive tsunami-like events took place during the period 23-27 June 2014 in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea regions, affecting countries from Spain to Ukraine. A few hours after midnight on 22/23 June, 1-meter tsunami-like oscillations were observed in Ciutadella Inlet on coast of the Balearic Islands (Spain). On 25 and 26 June, several tsunami-like waves with heights of up to 3 m struck a number of bays and harbours in the central and south Adriatic Sea. The strongest oscillations occurred in the morning of 25 June at the head of the 8-km long Vela Luka Bay.

The first site to record this event was Ciutadella Harbour, Menorca Island (Balearic Islands, Spain), where 10.5 min sea level oscillations with heights up to 1 m occurred during the night hours of 22/23 June. Two days later, on 25 June, tsunami-like waves with heights up to 3 m hit several bays in the Adriatic Sea (Croatia), and in the evening hours of the same day, Mazara del Vallo harbour on the southwestern coast of Sicily (Italy). On the following day, 26 June, tsunami-like waves with maximum heights of ~1 m were again observed in the Adriatic Sea and also on the coasts of Greece and Turkey. Finally, on 27 June, a sudden 1.5 m solitary wave swept beaches in Odessa (Ukraine) on the northwestern coast of the Black Sea. Substantial oscillations were also observed at a number of other sites along the Black Sea coast. (reference #12544)</p>"

After a series of defeats of the Persians in Greece, the Greek city of Potidaea, located at the base of the Pallene (Kassandra) Peninsula in the lowest place and blocking the entrance to the peninsula, rejected Persian rule. The Persian commander Artabaz besieged Potidaea, which was surrounded by sea. After three months of siege, a strong and persistent drop in the sea level set in. The Persians saw that the coastal sand - bank had become a marsh and advanced along the Pallene coast. When they had covered two fifths of the distance to Pallene through the marsh, huge sea flood began, such as had never occurred here, according to inhabitants, although high floods of tide had been observed quite often. <b>Those who could not swim drowned</b>, and others were killed by inhabitants of Potidaea, who rowed up to them.

At 3 in the night of May 3, a much stronger shock occurred and at the same time it began to rain, with such an impetuosity, that it was thought that the island was sinking under the weight of the sky. While the land was shaking with great violence, a strong wind coming from the high seas caused the water to rise over ten feet above sea level, and flooding the land threatened the city of Rhodes with total and final destruction. The wind was so violent, and the shocks so numerous (the ground was shaken, seven times that day) that the Rhodians thought their island was bound to sink. Soon after, however, all of a sudden, the waters retired to their habitual places, the sea became calm again, and the shaking of the ground stopped.

The earliest information about the earthquake of 10 September 1509 in the Sea of Marmara comes from a letter written five days after the event, dated 15 Sept 1509, by Nicolo Zustignan a Venetian in Istanbul. There can be no doubt that the correct date of the earthquake is 10 Sept 1509, at about 10 at night in the New Style (N.S.), and that, from what has already been said the date 14 Sept assigned to the event by most writers is erroneous. As a result of the earthquake, in some places in Istanbul and Pera the ground opened up and fissured, presumably along the coast of the Golden Horn. Also as a result of the earthquake the sea retreated from the shore and then returned, flooding the coast over a very large area at places that are not named. When the sea came back to its previous place, the ground near the coast opened up and was left fissured. This phenomenon was observed on both sides of the Golden Horn on the coasts of Istanbul and Pera. Modern writers claim that as a result of the earthquake the sea overtopped the sea walls of the city. This information comes from later authors, who say that the sea in the Golden Horn was so strongly shaken that it was thrown over the walls of Istanbul and Galata killing 12000 people. There is no indication <i>in primary sources</i> that the flooding of the coast of the Golden Horn by the sea at the time of the earthquake caused any damage or that the Sea of Maramara flooded the south coast of the city.

In Costantinople thousands of houses collapsed together with a large part of the city walls. Down-town residential quarters collapsed (Antonopoulos, r417). At Costantinople, during the shock the sea rushed inland, over the walls and flooded the streets in the city as well as the settlements outside the walls. The district of Galatas was heavily damaged by the sea-wave that caused many casualties (Anonimous, r475; Knolles, r476; Lycosthenes, r487).\r\nNear Galata and near Hereke Bay (north of gulf of Izmit) the coasts were flooded (Kuran, r388).

The information reported in... for this event is just a weak withdrawal of water at the mouth of the Tevere river near Rome, as referred to by several authors... The related earthquake occurred on February 2, 1703 at L&#39; Aquila (Central Apennines) causing very strong damages and fatalities in all the region. The epicentral area was located inland about 100 km from the Tevere river mouth. Going back to coeval sources, the belief that the link between the earthquake and the tsunami is quite casual rises stronger. This conviction is supported by the fact that the information on the withdrawal is reported only by Baglivi [ref #10545]: &#34;...at the time of the second shock they say that the latin sea it the mouth of the Tevere river near the harbour, wandered away from the shore just for a little; at the end of the earthquake the water immediately came back&#34;. All other coeval authors did not notice anything about the sea regression... Concluding, the distance from the earthquake epicentre and the limitation of the indirect testimony, leaves many doubts on the reliability of the sea effect.

However, the quantitative data on the height of the waves on these islands are contradictory. In the Japanese literature, the shaku (30.3 cm) and the jo (3.03 m) are usually used as a unit of measure of length. In all probability, the shaku and the jo were confused in a number of cases describing the tsunami. Miyako 10.5 m wave; Ishigaki 11.4 m wave. \r\n</p><p>The rise of water on Ishigaki Island can also be judged by the fact that a large stone (750 t) was transported to a height of 15 m. The three waves registered on both islands were observed for 2 hours; therefore one can assume that the period of the waves was about 30-40 minutes.\r\n</p><p>On Miyako and adjacent islands, 1,054 homes were washed away. A total of 2,548 people died, The villages situated on the Pacific coast of the islands of Miyako and Irabu suffered very heavily. In fact, at Miyakoku, Nissato, Uruka, and Tomosato homes, stone dikes and trees were washed away, and fields were scoured. On Tarama and Mizuna Islands, closest to the source, absolutely everything was washed away and the villages were leveled.\r\n</p><p>The tsunami approached Ishigaki Island and adjacent islands from the southeast, and the villages Maezato, Ohame, Miyara, Shiraho, Tozato, Ibaruma and Yasura, on the eastern coast, were completely washed away. More than half of the homes were washed away at the villages of Ishigaki, Shinkawa, Toyashiro, and Hirae, on the south side of the\r\nislands.\r\n</p><p>There was similar destruction on Kuroshlma and Aragusuku\r\nIslands; in all, 2,123 homes were washed away and 9,393 people died.\r\n</p><p>In all the Ryukyu Islands, this tsunami washed away and destroyed 3,137 homes and <b>killed 11,941 people</b>.

At the time of the most severe shocks, the ocean receded in the epicentral zone, only to rise and advance upon the shore again and again. In Valparaiso, at the time of a full ebb, the sea suddenly rose and just as suddenly receded. A launch from the admiral&#39;s ship, which was on its way to render assistance to people on shore, was thrown up to the gates of the customs house, located 3.5 m higher than the ordinary high tide mark. Suddenly, the sea began to recede very rapidly, stranding small vessels and boats. All this occurred within 15 minutes. Several minutes later, a second wave of reduced intensity appeared. In all, three large floods and ebbs of a height of 3.6 m (12 feet) were recorded. On the morning of the 20th, the sea level fluctuations were normal again. (reference #415)\r\n<p>1822 Nov. 19. Chile. Epicenter about 15 miles north of Valparaiso. Waves were reported along the coast from Rio Copiapo to Valdivia. The sea near Valparaiso rose to great heights, then receded so far that small boats were left dry upon the strand. It continued rising and falling to a gradually diminished extent for a quarter of an hour. The earthquake was also felt on board ships lying off Callao. Melipilla, Quillota, and Casablanca were destroyed by the earthquake. (reference #39)\r\n</p><p>1822, Nov. 19. During the first shock on the night of Nov. 19, the sea in Valparaiso harbour rose to a great height, so as to carry boats farther in than any boat had been before. It then receded so as to leave the small vessels, that were afloat before, dry on the beach. A few minutes later, there was a second wave, though not reaching the level of the first, possibly on account of the rise of about 3 ft. in the bed of the harbour.

On Neira Island, there were strong vertical shocks, which rapidly became undulating oscillations of growing force, which lasted 5 minutes.</p><p>At Bandaneria, 1/4 hour after the earthquake, the sea rose and the frightened residents took to the hills. The bay alternately dried up quickly, then filled with water. A ship riding at anchor at a depth of 9 m sat on the bottom twice. According to the account of the captain of the brig &#34;Hai&#34;, before the earthquake, the ship was riding at anchor at a depth of 11 m between the islands of Neira and Lonthor; the length of the anchor chain was 65 m. The seaquake was very strong. Then at 8:10, the sea which had risen quickly surged off to the southeast with unbelievable speed. During the strongest ebb, the depth of water fell to 7 m. After this, at still greater speed than it retreated, the water rose and ran 65 proas around which a few minutes prior had been left on dried bottom. Then the water once again surged back with terrible speed, destroying and carrying away everything. Twenty minutes after, the water rose again; the depth of the water was 14.5 m. This time the wave was as much stronger and more fearsome as it was higher. It inundated the breakwater and the embankment, where most of the crews of the proas had taken refuge, and carried them off. <b>Sixty people died</b>. Many proas, small and large, were tossed onto the embankment and destroyed. Buildings standing on the embankment were washed away. After this the water fell 8 m. Waves just as terrible recurred another four times, with the same period. At 10:30, the oscillations in level began to abate.</p><p>No considerable oscillations in sea level were observed on the north coast of Neira Island or on the south coast of Lonthor Island.</p><p>On Ai Island, the sea level was a meter higher than the usual flood tide level.</p><p>At Ambon [Amboina] the water level surpassed the usual flood tide level by approximately 20 cm. [Reference #132 lists 26 foot waves; reference #79 lists 8 m waves.]</p><p>On Saparua Island waves reached a height of 3 m above the level of the highest flood tides.</p><p>The tsunami was noticed on Haruku Island at the coastal settlements of Hulaliu and Wassu, on Laot Island at the settlements of Ameth, Akon, Laintu, and on Buru Island. On Ceram Island at the settlements of Amahai and Wahai [?], the water flooded homes near the beach; many proas were washed away. The tsunami was not noticed on Batjan Island.</p><p>In 1853, great physiographic changes were discovered between Kai Island and the two islands of Pulu Pisang, which belong to the same group. These changes were ascribed to the earthquake and tsunami of Nov 26, 1852. The surface of these islands was still soft and had a yellow golden color. Three new small islands were discovered betwen the islands of Tayandu (Trando) an Kaimer (Kauer). These islands were composed of fragments of corals and yellow sand. As was related, one of them was later washed away, while the other two were covered over with shrubs. In 1854, a new island was discovered between the islands of Pulu Ergodan and Pulu Hodin (according to other sources, it was situated in the region of Yut island, at 5<sup>o</sup> 35&#39; S. and 133<sup>o</sup> E.). The island was round, 250 m in diameter, and protruded above a bank with depths of no more than 2 m. It was made up of clay and was covered with shrubbery.</p><p>The report of the Chilean tsunami mentions that the tsunami of 1852 was observed in the Caroline Islands.</p><p>November 26 (16, 23), 1852, 6:42 [local time]. At Surabaja, there were light shocks, which were also felt at Semarang and Pasuruan. There was a weak shock at Sumenep. The earthquakes were accompanied by movements of the water from north to south in Grati Lake (Pasuruan District). [<i>Apparently, these data relate to the earthquake described above</i>.]</p>",

On a winter morning about 150 years ago, Hiro-mura village was hit by an earthquake. Upon seeing that the sea differed from usual the villagers evacuated to Hirohachiman Shrine, fearing a tsunami, but were relieved to see that no damage had occurred. However early afternoon of the next day, a villager rushed into Goryou&#39;s home and said, &#34;It&#39;s a crisis! The well water has run dry!&#34; At 4:00 in the evening, a huge earthquake incomparable to the one of the previous day occurred. Houses fell down and roof tiles were blown off. People repeatedly heard sounds like the roar of cannons, and dark cirrus clouds rapidly spread. Finally a huge tsunami rushed toward the village. &#34;Run! Head up the hill! A tsunami is coming!&#34; Swallowed by the waves, Goryou frantically yelled at the villagers and urged them to evacuate to Hirohachiman Shrine. The tsunami traveled up the river washing away houses and agricultural fields, and then returned to the sea at frightening speed. Left around them was a hopeless sight. Adults and children alike were milling around calling for and trying to find their families. Goryou noticed there must be people wandering around in the dark, unsure of where to evacuate to. Suddenly he thought, &#34;I know, I&#39;ll set fire to the rice sheaves up on the hill, even if it is a bit wasteful,&#34; and he set fire to the rice sheaves. Drawn by the fire the villagers who had failed to escape then started arriving on the hill one after another. &#34;Oh, I was saved because of the fire.&#34; Just as the 9th villager reached the safety zone, a tsunami much bigger than before rushed toward the village and also extinguished the fire of rice sheaves.</p>",

On Sangihe Is, after a sudden &#34;unbearable&#34; roar, the Awu Volcano began to erupt. Incandescent lava rushed down the slopes of the mountain with irresistible force, destroying everything in its path. Where the lava reached the shore, the sea water began to boil. Strong hot springs gushed up and the abundant surging boiling water destroyed and carried away everything that the fire had spared. \r\n</p><p>The sea surged onto the shore cliffs as during an underwater earthquake, and with a terrifying noise, it flooded the coast and &#34;snatched its victims from the fire.&#34;\r\n</p><p>An hour later, thunderous blows were heard, shaking the earth. A black column of ash and stones was ejected from the peak of the mountain. The column rose to the &#34;heavens&#34; and fell in a rain of fire on the slopes of the volcano, which were lit up by the red hot lava. Total darkness\r\nfell, in which one could not make out the closest objects; it was interrupted from time to time by outbreaks of light. Large bombs fell to the earth. The settlements and fields not destroyed by the lava were buried under a layer of ash and rocks. The flows rushed down from the mountain, and, encountering obstacles, spread out in lakes, which then became a new source of destruction.</p><p>All this took several hours. By midnight, all had quieted down, although the eruption began with new force the next noon. The ashfall continued all day and was so intensive that no light could penetrate, and almost total darkness set in.</p><p>A hurricane southeastern wind blew since the beginning of the eruption, and the ashes were carried as far as Mindanao Island. Later the wind blew from the north.</p><p>On March 17, there was a new eruption, in which fields and trees on the coast at Tabukan were destroyed. After this, the volcano quieted down, except that steam continuously rose from the numerous cracks and fractures. However, the lava flows were still so hot that one could not approach them. According to residents, the top of the volcano did not change noticeably in appearance.</p><p>At the main village of the island, Tahuna, several people were injured and homes were destroyed during the fall of ash and stones. Obstacles in the form of hills made the lava flow deviate from the village and turn to the sea in another place.</p><p>Along the flat slope between Tahuna and Kandhar, seven large lava flows descended to the sea, devastating this agricultural region. One of the flows passed through Kalongan village; only a few burned posts were left. Between Kalongan and Kandhar, a large area of the coast subsided below sea level. The mountain side had previously sloped gently to the very water line; after the eruption, it broke off as a steep wall about 60 m (200 feet) high.</p><p>The settlement of Kandhar, protected by this &#34;rib,&#34; suffered little: it was affected only by the fall of ashes and stones and the streams of hot water. In addition, before the eruption, the residents, fearing pirates, had hidden with their belongings in the thickets above the settlement, and did not suffer from the flooding.</p><p>The devastation was even greater on the coast from Kandhar to the northern tip of the island. Two tongues of lava thrust far into the sea to previous bottom marks of several metres (fathoms).</p><p><b>The number of victims was considerable: at Tahuna 722, at Kandhar 22, at Tabukan 2,039; total 2,806. For the most part, the people died in the gardens where they sought relief  from the heat. Those who attempted to run, were overtaken by flows of lava and water, perished under collapsing trees, were suffocated or were burned in the ashfall and the fires.

The flooding was markedly greater at some places than at others, and the impression was created that this was due to the propagation of waves in a southwestern direction, at an angle of 45 degrees to the coast.

The shocks were very severe on Ambrym, Pentecost and Espritu Santo. So far as could be learnt no loss of life had taken place, but on the coast station dwellings were shaken to pieces. The earthquake was due to an eruption of a volcano near Epi. Describing that outburst, a passenger by the steamer La Parouse said: &#34;Immense vomiting jets of smoke and flame went skyward. The spectacle as viewed from the deck of the La Parouse was impressively grand.&#34; The eruption was followed by a tidal wave, which did infinitely greater damage to the plantations than the eruption. \r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #414:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>In addition, a wave appeared at Kailua on the western coast of Hawaii at 11:30 local time...At Keahou, 10 km to the south, a home washed away.

        "comments": "<b>The seismic sea wave of 1902 February 27 is a spurious\r\nevent</b>. On 26 February at 19 h local time (27 February 00 h 36 m UT) a tidal wave flooded the coast of Ahuachapan in El Salvador from Garita Palmera to Barra del Paz and beyond, a distance of about 120 km. The height of the wave is not mentioned, but allegedly about 100 persons were drowned at San Diego and 85 at Barra del Paz. Some property damage was caused on the coast of Acajutla and Cara Sucia. Some writers associate this event with a spurious earthquake on 1902 February 26 (Cruz &amp; Wyss 1983, reference #82) or with the earthquake of 1903 April 19. However, there is evidence that this <i><b>wave was not triggered by an earthquake, but rather that it was the result of a combination of a high tide and abnormal meteorological conditions</b></i><b> (Anderson 1908, reference #7975; List 1903, reference #8016). Most of the earthquakes associated with seismic sea waves are located just off the coast or a few tens of km inland at distances from the shore comparable with their source dimensions. It is not clear whether these waves were due to tectonic movements of the seabed; the evidence for some off the southeast coast of Costa Rica points to submarine slumping or to their being seiches set up in Fonseca, Nicoya and Chiriqui bays. (reference #8015)\r\n<p>1902, Feb 26. 13.5 N 89.5 W, validity likely, tsunami magnitude 2.  On February 26, the residents of the Pacific coast border regions of Guatemala and El Salvador heard a loud rumble, like cannon shots, which appeared to come from under the bottom of the sea. A strong earthquake then occurred. Soon the residents saw the water retreating, exposing the sea bottom for a considerable distance. After this, a black wall arose at sea: this was a large wave, whose might increased as it approached the shore. The wave surged onshore with terrifying force. The residents did not have time to run to safety and they perished. The tsunami was observed on a 120-km stretch of coast which included Acajutla, Ecuador. <b>One hundred people died and about the same number were injured</b> at Barra de Santiago settlement. About <b>85 people died</b> at the village of Barra del Pas. Homes and trees were washed out to sea, and the clothes were ripped from people caught by the water.

At about 7 p.m. three waves, of which the first was the smallest, swept on the land and caused great damage.

According to observations at Finsh Harbor, about 15 minutes after the earthquake the sea &#34;began to rumble&#34; and a larger roller surged in, as a result of which the water level rose 1.2-1.5 m above the flood tide mark. The lowlying part of the coast was flooded, and the dike between the land and Madang Island, which was built of large coral blocks, was washed out. &#34;Freezing&#34; for 1/2 minute, the flood tide receded just as quickly and unexpectedly as it had appeared and the subsequent ebb tide was a good 1.5 m lower than the strongest equinoctial ebb tides. The flood tide recurred many times, but an unusually low level of the sea in general obtained until 10:00. Only after that did the water again return slowly to its normal level. The inhabitants of the villages on the islands escaped to &#34;the big land&#34; from the oncoming flood tide and dared to return to their homes only many days later.

According to observations in Finschhafen, the sea roared enormously for about 15 min after the first tremor and a spring tide appeared. The water level rose to 1.2 to 1.5 m above highest sea-level mark, and the low-lying coastal areas were flooded;a causeway constructed from massive coral blocks from the mainland to the island of Madang was completely washed away. After remaining at the highest level for half a minute, the flood ran off as quickly as it appeared. After remaining at the highest level for about half a minute, the flood ran of as quickly as it appeared. The following low tide was about 1.5 m below the normal spring low tide during the change of the monsoon. The high tide returned several times; the unusual low tide remained until 10 a.m. Thereafter the water level rose slowly to normal. The natives from the island villages, Quamquam, Sisalum, etc., fled from the flood wave to the mainland and did not return to their villages for days. Especially important may be the report from Missionary J.S. Pfalzer (observation by Missionary Hansche) that no flood wave occurred on the island of Ruk; on the contrary the water retreated there. Is there not a possibility that sudden submarine slumping may have caused the movement of the water masses? Also Missionary G. Bamler locates the epicentre between Kaiser Wilhelm Land and Neu-Pommern and considers a block down thrust. In this connection it also remarkable that according to Missionary Hansche, on the day before the earthquake, on September 14th, smoke emerged from the volcano on the island of Tupinier. \r\n</p><p>1906, Sept 15, 01:30 [local time].

Second, none of the sources of information are contemporary reports. Based on contemporary reports, this event did not pass the confirmation due to two reasons. First, it was reported that the rumor about a catastrophic tidal wave in Amoy was not true [Q14]. The damage in Amoy was reported to be slight and no sea-surge was observed (Shen Bao, 23rd January 1918). Second, it was reported that westerners in Shantou took refuge on ships (Shen Bao, 26th January 1918), which is an unusual behaviour if the coast was just attacked by a tsunami.

        "comments": "1918, October 11, 10:14 local time. A severe earthquake at 10:14 Local Time in the Mona Passage, west of Puerto Rico was caused by displacement along four segments of a normal fault, oriented N-S in the Mona Canyon (Ref #267). A tsunami with runup heights reaching 6 m followed the earthquake, causing extensive damage along the western and northern coasts of Puerto Rico, especially to those villages established in a flood plain. \r\n<p>Many of the runup heights associated with this event were measured by Reid and Taber (Ref #1078) using water marks on visible objects. Other heights were provided by reliable witnesses who were interviewed by Reid and Taber during their visit to Puerto Rico and St. Thomas for four weeks in late 1919.\r\n</p><p>In the disastrous tsunami that lashed the northwest coast at Aguadilla in 1918, 30 People were said to have drowned at Aguadilla alone. This was later revised to\r\n32 victims, The eight deaths of victims drowned at Punta Agujereada by the waves 5.5 to 6 meters in height brought the initial tally of people drowned for these two locations to 40. The greatest number of fatalities was said to be from\r\nthe tsunami, The official death toll for this event was placed at 116. This total must have been earthquake fatalities only, since at Mayagiiez, &#34;more than 100&#34;\r\ndeaths were reported, plus the 4 deaths at Ponce (totaling 104). When added to the tsunami victim count of 40, this would tally 144. In 1997, Mercado Irizarry (personal communication, 1997a) updated the tsunami death toll, with the report October 11, 1918, Puerto Rico of an account by an &#34;old, very well known gentleman in Aguadilla.&#34; He said,\r\n&#34;deaths should have exceeded 100. The reason was that many persons were unaccounted for and, therefore, not included in the official toll.&#34; Even more recently, Dillon et al. (1999) reported that 91 people were killed by the tsunami\r\nin northwestern Puerto Rico. With the significantly higher totals of those who perished from the waves, the total fatalities for the disaster from both the earthquake and tsunami approaches a number greater than 200. (ref #1492)</p><p>A 1918 M 7.5 earthquake resulted in a tsunami that killed at least 91 people in northwestern Puerto Rico. (ref #1591) </p><p>This was one of the most violent earthquakes felt on Puerto Rico since its occupation by Europeans. Immediately following the shock a tsunami broke upon the shore, drowning many persons and destroying many native dwellings. Property damage was estimated at about $4 million and 116 lives were lost. (Ref #1128)</p><p>The October 11, 1918 Mona Passage earthquake triggered a tsunami\r\nthat affected the western coast of Puerto Rico. The cause of the tsunami was previously suggested to be due seafloor displacement by a normal fault on the eastern wall of the Mona Rift(Mercado and McCann, 1998). We have identified a submarine landslide with steep headwall and sidewalls scarps 15 km off the northwestern coast of Puerto Rico using\r\nnewly available multibeam bathymetry and multichannel seismic reflection profiles. Based on these new data we postulate that the landslide, which was induced by the earthquake, was responsible for the generation of the tsunami. Supporting this idea is the documented rupture of submarine telegraph cables by landslides in the area of our\r\nmapped landslide during the earthquake (Reid and Taber, 1919). The landslide, which is well marked by fresh and steep scarps, is 9 km wide by 9 km in length in the excavation area, and it has an average thickness of 140-150 m.

No reporter who examined the waterfront after the\r\nearthquake was able to find any evidence of high water, however, and no reliable witness of the phenomenon has been found, so this report must be discounted completely... As was, stated in Chapter 1, there as no evidence of heavy tidal waves sweeping into the harbor.

        "comments": "On December 12, 1979 at 07:59:4.3 UTC a major earthquake measuring 7.9 occurred along the Pacific Coast of Colombia. The earthquake and tsunami associated with it were responsible for the destruction of at least six fishing villages and the death of hundreds of people in the Narino State of Colombia. At least 15 other coastal towns in the area were rocked by the earthquake and were damaged by the waves. Waves measuring anywhere from 2-5 meters destroyed many of these coastal villages. People along the coast, who survived the earthquake by running outside their homes, were carried away a few minutes later by the large tsunami waves generated by the earthquake. Six fishing boats, one with 40 men aboard, were lost. A pier on the prison island of Gorgona was destroyed, however, no injuries from either the earthquake or the tsunami were reported from there. Most of the houses at Charco, a village of 4,000 which were built on stilts over a lake were knocked into the water. Waves sent the Iscuande River out of its banks along the Pacific coast. The wall of water reportedly in the village of Iscuande caused extensive damages. At least one person was reported dead from that area.\r\n<p>Hardest hit of all the coastal villages was the fishing village of San Juan, where the waves completely overran the island destroying just about everything in their path. Numerous deaths were reported from San Juan which was totally devastated and is in the process of being relocated further inland at the present time. According to eyewitness reports, 3 to 4 waves were observed, the first wave arriving approximately 10 minutes after the main earthquake. The water recessed first to about 3 meters below the level of the sea. The first wave arrived minutes later. The third wave was the largest, and at San Juan Island it was approximately 5 meters above the level of the tide, which fortunately, was at its lowest at that time.\r\n</p><p>The maximum difference between low and high tide in the region for that time of the year was approximately 1.3 meters, thus, the maximum wave could have been that much more, if it had arrived at high tide, and numerous more deaths could have resulted. Considering that the mean elevation of the coastal islands is approximately 2 to 2.5 meters above high tide, it would mean that maximum waves would have completely overrun all of the coastal islands in the area. Approximately 30-35 km of the coast was hardest hit by the tsunami, while the length of the area hardest hit by the earthquake was approximately 225 km in length, from Guapi to Tumaco.\r\n</p><p><b>It is estimated that the majority of casualties (at least 80%) were the result of the tsunami rather than of the earthquake. An ITIC estimate based on informal reports is that 500-600 people may have been killed by the combined effects of the earthquake and tsunami with about 4,000 people injured. Homes of at least 10,000 persons were destroyed.</b>\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #3330)\r\n</p><p>The tsunami caused great damage, and was similar in scope to the event of January 31, 1906. Ramirez and Goberna (1980) note that the wave arrived 3 minutes after the earthquake, at San Juan de la Costa. The only death toll from the tsunami is from Tumaco (36 deaths). There may have been other deaths from the tsunami, but they have been included with the earthquake counts by disaster agencies.\r\n</p><p>Ephemeral Island 10.8N, 75.4W. An island 30 meter long, 5 meter wide and 7 meter high was formed during the night of December 12, 1979 in the Caribbean Sea, 300 meters off the coast of Punta Canoa, Colombia. The sawtoothed island was composed to greenish-gray clay, apparently squeezed upward through a fissure. By Dec 29, the island was only half its initial size and disappeared under the pounding of strong waves on Jan 9, 1980. The Caribbean coast of Colombia is well-known for its mud volcanoes, which\r\nhave &#34;eruptions&#34; driven by petroleum gases.

The raft rose 5 to 6 feet. The water receded to the bay after 15 minutes or longer and took the form of a strong rip current. As in 1993, debris was carried up the river for a distance of two miles. Talofofo bay is shaped to focus the water to the river mouth at the head of the bay giving a higher water level there. However, there must have been observable waves elsewhere on the northern and western coasts but this area is lightly developed and no known surveys were taken. The tsunami was not reported as having been recorded in Guam and the marigrams have not yet been located. It was recorded in Japan with heights of 26 cm at Hachi, 24 cm at Murotomisaki, 23 cm at Chichijima, 22 cm at Tosashimizu, 19 cm at Yaene, 16 cm at Mera, 15 cm at Kushimoto, 10 cm at Aburatsu, 7 cm at Owase, 6 cm at Choshi, and 4 cm at\r\nUchiura and Naha, in Hawaii with a height of 24 cm at Kailua-Kona, at Midway Island with a height of 6 cm, at\r\nWake Island with a height of 4cm, and at Truk Island with a height of 3 cm. (reference #482)\r\n<p>The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) has been routinely operating two Permanent Ocean Bottom Seismograph Systems (OBS). One was developed and installed off Cape Omaezaki in 1978 by the Meteorological Research Institute. The other was deployed by the Headquarters of JMA in 1986 off the Boso Peninsula, Kanto District. The OBS off Cape Omaezaki has four seismographs and one pressure gauge for detecting tsunamis, and another system has four seismographs and three pressure gauges. The OBS system of JMA has a long cable for transmitting signals to the station on land. On April 5,1990, another small tsunami was generated by an earthquake of Ms 7.5 near the Mariana Islands, and it was observed at many stations in Japan. We can find in the records of the OBS tsunami-meter not only sea level changes, such as tide and tsunami, but also thermally induced fluctuations and pressure variations caused by ground motion. Traces at TK1 and BSl show the ocean tide fairly well, however the ones at BS2 and Bs3 are surely deformed by thermally induced effects. Another type of thermal noise appears around eight o&#39;clock and continued for about two hours on the records of TK1. Ground motion noise begins at the same time as the earthquake at\r\n6:13 on April 6, JST (9 hours ahead to Greenwich Mean Time) and continues for about two hours. This noise is larger, as the water is deeper. Tsunami waves can be seen for several hours from about ten o&#39;clock, however the amplitudes in the deep sea are much smaller than sea level fluctuations at\r\nthe tide stations.

Rather, we show that the model of an underwater landslide, presumably triggered by the earthquake, and taking place on the steep slopes of the continental shelf approximately 10 km offshore, can fit the principal inundation characteristics identified during the survey[...]The testimony of our witnesses confirms that a tsunami did take place following the 1990 Rudbar earthquake, the largest event recorded in northern Iran in modern times, even though it remained relatively modest and its flooding resulted in no significant damage or casualties.

        "comments": "The tsunami hazard in Futuna is poorly documented. The only historical tsunami is associated with the 12 March 1993, MW 6.4 earthquake that caused \u223c0.5 m uplift of the reef along the southern coast of Futuna (Regnier, 1994). A small tsunami was reported along Futuna&#39;s south coast but no further observations of the wave were noted (Monzier et al., 1993; Capecchi, 1995). Immediate post-1993 earthquake studies focused on the extensive damage caused by the event including the destruction of every church greater than 100 years old. An earlier earthquake in 1840, with strong ground shaking and intense building damage, was described by the missionary station of St Pierre Chanel, but no tsunami was noted. In addition to historical records, some oral traditions provide tantalising evidence of prehistoric events that may have been catastrophic tsunamis, but age estimates are unclear (Di Piazza and Frimigacci, 1991). While sparse, the data discussed above indicate that the tsunami hazard is real, and the risk for the population who live almost exclusively along the low-lying coast is high. (reference #6956)\r\n<p>The shock was followed by a small tidal wave, localized at  Leava Bay, which caused extensive damage on boats who were there. On this subject, it is noted the authorities broadcasted by radio shortly after the start of the crisis, a message advising people to climb the mountain following the strong earthquake. The Futunians have fully complied with this instruction, fleeing the high part of the island after the earthquake of 13 March (the message being broadcast only Futunan, Europeans were generally not in present and therefore do not respond ...). Although in this case no significant tidal wave happened this evacuation along the coastal plain is be considered still valid in the event of strong shaking (it is not needed to stay more than 1 or 2 hours in the mountains, the tidal wave, in this case, having a local origin and thus occurring a few minutes after the earthquake). (reference #11511)\r\n</p><p>March 12, 1993 earthquake Futuna (14,248 2 S 178 298 2 W,Mb &#61; 5.9, Ms &#61; 6.5 PDE) killed three people. Caused damage to structures all over the island. It produced numerous landslides onshore all around the island, offshore and triggered a small tsunami. It likely caused uplift on the island by at least 50 cm as shown by the newly uplifted coral reefs along the southern coast. (reference #11520)</p>",

In an email on May 30, Prasetya said, &#34;We conclude that no tsunamis have been generated directly by the earthquake which was reported by the newspaper to have occurred on 14 May 1995. The wave run-up occurred at some places due to land subsidence in coastal areas.&#34; There is probably a problem with the understanding of the definition of\r\na tsunami.

Following intensive rescue efforts by local officials and other authorities from the Federation, numerous survivors were found, however, over 1,500 people lost their lives from this earthquake that reduced apartment buildings in Neftegorsk to heaps of\r\nrubble. The town of Neftegorsk, before the earthquake, had a\r\npopulation of 2,997. According to a preliminary report filed in early June by Alexei Ivashchenko and Victor Kaistrenko, two Federation scientific investigation teams comprised of the Seismological Party and Institute of Marine Geology and Geophysics are at the earthquake\r\nregion collecting macroseismic data and traces of possible\r\nsmall tsunami. One group reported that a small but not distinct tsunami due to this event occurred on the Okhotsk Sea coast near the settlements of Sabo and Val according to information from fishermen that were on the coast the night of the event. They  reported that near Sabo &#34;ice on the Okhotsk sea started to go to the coast after the earthquake&#34;, and, near Val, &#34;water waves came to the river mouth after the earthquake.&#34; Another report stated there was small wave action of about 20 cm near the mouth of the Sabo River in the Piltun Gulf. Preliminary information from the nearest tide gauge at Nogliki (about 150 km to the south from Neftegorsk) indicates no tsunami was recorded. \r\nA Japanese seismological team has joined the tearns from\r\nRussia and have installed a local seismic network that is\r\nregistering about 500 (small) aftershocks per day.

There were strong tremors at Port Alberni, Bamfield, on Cape Pachena, and weak ones at Vancouver, Nanaimo and Port Townsend. Tremors were also felt at Abbotsford, Duncan, Covichane, Victoria, Port Renfrew, on Tatoosh Island and Destruction Island. Small tidal waves occurred near Bamfield. (reference #415)\r\n<p>At Alberni it was like a loud report, and near Bamfield small tidal waves were reported. (reference #9755)\r\n</p><p>Although the tremor was distinctly felt by residents in Victoria, its most severe manifestation was at Port Alberni and Alberni where a loud report was followed by a rumbling of the earth. At about the same moment, according to reports from Bamfield, residents at the wireless station observed a wavering light in the sky and fishermen of the vicinity say the phenomena was followed by two very big waves rolling in to shore. (reference #9756)\r\n</p><p>Mr. F. Napier Denison, director of the observatory, places the location 100 miles west by north of Victoria, off Pachena Point, which appears to have been the centre of disturbance.

Tehuantepec was reduced to ruins. The streets running from west to east suffered more than the streets running north to south. Most of the residents left the city.

On June 14, the geologists Sanchez and Rangel went out from Mexico City to investigate the earthquake.

A seaquake was registered in Bali Strait. A strong shock was felt in the vicinity of Pasuruan at about 23:15; it was followed by six or seven weaker shocks. The duration was almost 4 minutes. A shock was also felt at Malang. In addition, an eruption of the Lamongan volcano occurred at night (Wichmann, 1918, ref #2705). In the same year (date unknown), large earthquake lasting 3 minutes occurred at Bima (Sumbawa Island). The shocks were so strong that people could not stand, and all stone structures crumbled. In the bay, the sea level rose 3 1/2 m (2 fathoms), and a tidal wave fell on the city (Wichmann, 1918 ref #2705; Cox, 1970, ref #2689). According to Sieberg (1932, ref #1576), both reports relate to the same event. (reference #414)",

The third wave rolled onto the coast at the settlement and advanced beyond the usual flood tide line, but did not reach the homes. The water was an unusual green color. (reference #414)",

        "comments": "On September 14, 1953 at 12:17 [local time] there was an earthquake and tsunami on the Fiji Islands. <b>Two persons perished, one under a landslide, the other by the collapse of a building.</b>\r\n<p>According to eyewitnesses, the water level at the entrance to the harbour of Suva began to recede immediately after the seismic shocks. The wave height reached 2 m (6 feet). The dock area was devastated; a supporting wall was severely damaged as a result of blows on mooring bollards and wall embrasures, and several yachts and boats were sunk.\r\n</p><p>In the opinion of Houtz, the wave resulted from currents &#34;descending&#34; from both slopes into the inlet channel and their collision in the channel. Depth surroundings carried out after the earthquake indicated that the water level along the edges of the inlet, which was flanked by steep coral reefs, had risen by 24 m (80 feet), whereas, in the channel it had dropped by 7 1/2 m (25 feet). \r\n</p><p>Two waves arrived at the island of Mbengga: one with a height of 0.3 m arrived 30 seconds after the earthquake, the other with a height of 1.2-1.5 m (4-5 feet) arrived 15 minutes after the quake.\r\n</p><p>The second wave, like the tidal wave at Nakasaleka on the island of Kandavu, which was observed 12 minutes after the earthquake, and like the wave that approached Navua and Laucala 15 minutes after the earthquake, evidently was generated in an area northeast of the island of Mbengga. After the earthquake, variations in the water level of up to 100 m (300 feet) were determined by echo sounding. It is\r\npossible that turbidity currents played a part in generating the wave, since underwater cables in the area of the epicenter were displaced, broken and buried under loose alluvium. On the basis of the damage the cables had suffered, the velocity of the bottom currents was estimated to be 10-20 knots. It should be noted that the main tsunami started on the southern coast off the island of Viti-Levu, at low tide, whereas the times of the wave passage referred to above correspond to the high tide which followed.\r\n</p><p>The tsunami was observed within a radius of approximately 330 km (180 miles) from the indicated center. \r\n</p><p>The waves were observed on the island of Kandavu and west of the island of Lau.\r\n</p><p>The waves had their greatest height, by various estimates, from 3 to 15 m (10-50 feet) at the reefs bordering the southern coast of Viti-Levu. The first wave was the strongest.  The approaching waves could be seen at distances of 2-4 km from the beach. Huge pieces of coral reef were thrown up onto dry land.\r\n</p><p>In a number of places, coastal villages and individual houses were seriously damaged. <b>In Suva, three persons were drowned in the tsunami waves and two on the island of Kandavu. Twelve persons received serious injuries.</b> The general property damage from the tsunami amounted to approximately one tenth of that caused by the earthquake. \r\n</p><p>The tsunami was recorded by tidal gauges in Pago Pago, where it had an amplitude of 20 cm (0.7 feet); in Honolulu where the wave had an amplitude of 6 cm (0.2 feet), a period of 16 minutes, and appeared in 7.3 hours after the earthquake; in Port Allen where it had an amplitude of\r\napproximately 10 cm; and in Hilo where it had a smaller amplitude.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #415)\r\n</p><p>Reference #79 lists five killed.\r\n</p><p>Damage caused directly as a result of the 1953 tsunami has been estimated at about $50,000 (1953 values). Damage was caused to the wharf facilities in Suva, roads, seawalls, bridges and buildings. The above estimate of damage refers only to Government structures and . no effective estimate of the losses to private holdings was made (Houtz, 1962). Three people were drowned in Suva as a result of the tsunami and two more on Kadavu island. (reference #11911)</p>",

        "comments": "A new island emerged from the ocean offshore of the city of Gwadar, Pakistan, after a strong magnitude-7.7 earthquake shook the country this morning (Sept. 24). The mound appears to be 20 to 40 feet (6 to 12 m) high and 100 feet (30 m) wide, DIG Gwadar Moazzam Jah, a district police officer, told Pakistan&#39;s Geo News. It rose out of the sea at a spot located about 350 feet (100 m) from the coast, he said...  A mud volcano is a likely possibility because Gwadar&#39;s coastline already has several of the gurgling, steamy cones, both onshore and at sea... And in 1945, the magnitude-8.1 Makran temblor triggered the formation of mud volcanoes offshore of Gwadar, according to a study on mud volcanoes in Pakistan published in 2005. A recent study in the journal Nature Geoscience also suggests the 1945 earthquake released tons of methane from the seafloor...But Geologist Dave Petley, a landslide expert, thinks the island&#39;s low, arcuate (or bow) shape - as seen in the few pictures released so far - suggests a rotational landslide, rather than a conical mud volcano.(reference #10751)\r\n<p>Three tide gauges and one DART station in the Arabian Sea observed the tsunami. (reference #10750)\r\n</p><p>A mud volcano caused an island which measured approximately 76 m long, 30 m wide and 18 m high to form in the Arabian Sea about 600 meters off the coast near Gwadar, Pakistan. A tsunami was recorded with the following maximum wave heights: 0.17 m at Chah Bahar and 0.09 m at Jask, Iran; 0.26 m at Muscat, Oman. (reference #1053)\r\n</p><p>This earthquake triggered a tsunami that was recorded by various sea-level tide gauges along the coastal regions of the Arabian Sea and tsunami buoys in the Arabian Sea[...]The sudden uplift of the mud island might have caused the tsunami generation, which was clearly mapped by the backward ray tracing technique in this case study. The sudden uplift of mud island or submarine slumping might have caused the tsunami generation,which could be clearly mapped by the backward ray tracing technique as admissible tsunamigenic source. (reference #12691)\r\n</p><p>The modest tsunami recorded at the buoy and at Muscat (Oman)and Chah Bahar (Iran) was generated not by slip on the megathrust or a related splay fault but on a fault within the Makran accretionary prism, which is being shortened and uplifted by subduction.

Given that earthquakes in the Taupo Volcanic Zone can be very shallow, and fault rupture has occurred in historical time from earthquakes with magnitudes as low as MW6.5 and in swarms in which the largest magnitudes are low magnitude 5s, it is possible that earthquake was shallow enough to cause a small amount of deformation.

I did not feel myself safe from the fatal influences of the island until the canoe rocked on the waves of the Gulf of Paria. As soon as I was sufficiently recovered, Pakiri told me that, thanks to the doctor&#39;s permits, the three schooners had passed the customs and set sail at night. On the first shock being felt on the quay, he had made every man take his place on board; this measure had saved the canoe from the ill-effects of the earthquake on the waters of the port. Twice had the sea ebbed out of sight, leaving vessels high and dry, but it had returned with a rush, and had filled and turned over every vessel which was not properly prepared.

The size of water level change\r\nobserved in the entrance to Stonehaven harbour was 1.25m. The following account comes from an email report passed on by Harbourmaster James Brown from Aberdeenshire Council. The harbour at Stonehaven: ...experienced a tidal surge at the harbour last night at 19.30, when the water suddenly started to rush out for about 5 minutes dropping about 1.25\r\nmtrs, then after a couple of minutes returned with some force. Several small vessels were affected by the unexpected changes in tidal flow as water first flowed out of the harbour then returned. Two 40ft vessels had their\r\nrails damaged and stanchion posts pulled out of place as the tide changed. On the Sovereign the foremast was ripped out of its socket by a mooring rope causing a serious head injury to a crewman. Initial investigations found evidence that a number of tide gauges around Scotland had reported unusual tidal movements. Similar tidal movements were reported by human observers in Gourdon harbour. The tide gauge at Aberdeen showed possible seiche activity from 1800 UTC on 1 July, with the residual levels varying between about plus 20cm and minus 15cm around the\r\nmean, based upon 15min data... It is evident then that pressure anomalies were observed near or ahead of the travelling convective cells, thus showing that it is likely that there was a convectively generated surface pressure wave travelling northwards. The speed of movement was\r\napproximately 46kn and correlated with the time that sea-level changes were reported along the coast. This supports the belief that meteorological factors were responsible for generating and maintaining a tsunami-like\r\nwave in the North Sea. (reference #11466)"

About 2 o&#39;clock in the afternoon the man at the wheel noticed an unwonted agitation of the ocean and called to the captain, who quickly discovered that some miles ahead of the ship the sea seemed to have arisen from its bed and was approaching the St. Paul with the speed of a railroad train. \r\n<p>The captain had sailed too long in these waters not to know a tidal wave when he saw one and immediately called every man on deck and gave orders to hastily make everything as secure as possible.

Its magnitude can only be fully understood by those acquainted with the bay, but some idea of the force with which the great mass of earth broke away from the steep hill sides on the Holmes&#39;s Bay side of the harbour can be gathered from the fact that upon rushing into the sea it created a wave which swept across the bay towards the wharf in front of Messrs Hay&#39;s homestead with sufficient violence to hurl huge rocks from the seaside over the embankment, and onto the road. The distance from where the debris went into the sea across the bay to where the wave struck is not less than half a mile, and it is said that some of the rocks lifted by its force and hurled across the road are over 200 pounds in weight. The rush of water swept clean over the wharf, across the road, and up to the plantation alongside Messrs Hay&#39;s residence, carrying before it fences, trees, and in fact, everything that offered the least resistance to its progress.&#34; (The Star, 11 July 1895)\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #11688:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>There was another landslip at Pigeon Bay which must have been of extraordinary dimensions.

Big waves were rushing inland from time to time while great rock slices fell into the sea. On the 29th of September, when the shaol made its appearance, a huge wave devastated the island, in many places where the shores were flat invaded the coast for two miles. On the west coast of the island of Patmos the wave reached heights over 100 feet while on the east coast the sea rose to 90 feet. On the island of Ios the height of the wave was 60 feet and on the island of Sikinos the sea advanced over 300 yards inland.

There was a catastrophic eruption of the Krakatau volcano, which was accompanied by an enormous tsunami. The maximal height of rise of water was 30 m on the shores of the Sunda Strait, 4 m on the south coast of Sumatra Island, 2-2 1/2 m on the northern and southern shores of Java Island, 1/2-1 m in the Pacific Ocean as far as South America. In Indonesia, 36,000 people died. The main eruption was preceded by less strong ones on the 26th at 17:07 and 19:00-23:00, the 27th at 1:42, 5:30 and 6:44, which were also accompanied by less intensive tsunamis. \r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #236:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>1883, August 27, 02:59. The explosive eruption of the volcano, Krakatau in the Sunda Strait, produced air-pressure waves, which were recorded by the Honolulu tide gage as a 0.2-m wave. These are not considered to be tsunami waves. \r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #237:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>1883, August 27, 0259 GMT. The explosion of the Krakatau Volcano in Indonesia generated a 30-m tsunami in the Sundra Strait that destroyed numerous towns and killed about 36,000 people. The explosion was heard about 3,000 miles away. It also caused an atmospheric pressure wave that was recorded on the tide gages at remote locations including South Georgia Island, Panama, France, England, Hawaii, Alaska, and San Francisco. Due to the shadowing by continents and island groups, a direct tsunami could not have reached most of these locations. Harkrider and Press (1967) show that the direct air waves (acoustic) are the first to be recorded. Atmospheric gravity waves with phase and group velocities nearer the oceanic gravity wave velocity (sqrt(gd)) occurred and may have excited water waves (tsunamis) by transferring energy to the ocean. The longer the fetch, the more energy that would be transferred.\r\nThese waves are the most energetic and are created beyond the land mass shadow zones. The initial acoustic waves, too, may create resonances in the coastal and harbor areas as seiches. To consider these to be true tsunamis is a stretch of the definition but atmospheric gravity waves are or may be a source for tidal disturbance which resemble tsunamis.  It was recorded with an amplitude of six inches at Sausalito.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #9779:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>The voluminous pyroclastic flows entered the sea where they generated tsunami, and may have produced secondary explosion\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #2990:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>The largest and most devastating volcanic tsunami of the last 250 years was produced by the Aug 26, 1883 eruption of Krakatoa volcano.

The waves raised large ships to 10 m above sea level and carried them as far as 3 km inland. These waves deluged more than 250 villages in western Java and eastern Sumatra killing more than 36,000 people. Fatalities due to waves occurred as far as 800 km from the volcano. Small tsunami waves were recorded throughout the Pacific Ocean, and small sea level oscillations were measured at sites thousands of kilometers away in the Indian Ocean, France and England. \r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #4653:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>Krakatoa exploded August 27, 1883 obliterating 5 square miles of land and leaving a crater 3.5 miles across and 200-300 meters deep.

        "comments": "A witness (Daisy B.) recalls an event near Bwelic, north of the La Ouaieme River along the northeast coast of Grande-Terre in 1936 after March (cross-checked). The witness mentions that, on a fair-weathered day, in the morning, three successive waves, the third being the strongest, hit the coast. After the second wave, the sea largely receded exposing the land reef. A &#34;terrific suction noise&#34; was heard. The withdrawal between the second and the third wave is estimated to have reached one to a few meters in height. Then, the largest wave came and flooded the coast. Seaweed, sea worms and fish are washed up on shore. A bakery, several piers and boat sheds were damaged. The water level reached the base of the stairs of the living quarters of the residents. During an on-site visit on 6 August 2008 by one of the authors (j.C), the altitude reached by the sea was estimated to be 1.2 m above the highest lunar tides (a geodetic point on the small bridge on the Bwelic creek was used as a reference point for measurement; equivalent to &#43; 2.2 m). At Tova, 1.5 km south of Bwelic in front of the Pouai Pass, the sea level also reached the bases of several house stairs on the shore. A value, more approximate than the one in Bwelic (since the local geodetic reference point was not found) of 2.2 m above the highest tides was estimated (equivalent &#43; 3.2 m). At this location, the sea is currently 300m away. No link could be made between these time periods and any earthquake, but the phenomenon seems to be linked to a local quake and/or landslide.

According to the information from coastal resident community, during a fine day, waves with height of 2 m to 3 m attacked the coast several times, damaged house walls and trees near the coast. To confirm the possibility of the tsunami at the coast, the first author of this report did a survey at the coast during March, 2008. It was found during the survey that waves only caused inundation in a very narrow area, with the largest inundation distance of several ten meters from the water line. Also, infiltrated waves dissipated onshore very rapidly. By comparing damage by the waves with damage by a typical tsunami with the same height (such as the tsunami in West Java July, 2006), it can be remarked that it is difficult to conclude that the above mentioned waves are tsunami. The waves might be wind waves in combination with wave/wind setup and high flood tide. (reference #12499)"

        "comments": "A volcanic eruption in the Karymskoye freshwater lake in eastern Kamchatka began in the afternoon of January 2nd and continued for about 10 to 20 hours. The initial observation from an over flight at 15:40 LT showed that the ice cover of the lake had melted and a phreatomagmatic eruption was in progress from a vent off the northern shore of the lake in a water depth of 40-50 m. Explosions occurred every 4 to 12 minutes. Six explosions were observed with an average interval of 6 minutes between them. Between explosions the lake water displayed intensive bubbling and steaming. The strongest explosions produced a rapidly rising, smooth-surfaced bulb-like mass of expanding gas and pyroclastics. This bulb grew to a height of 450 m, and then it began to collapse as jets of black pyroclastics mixed with steam pierced the shell. A light gray &#34;collar&#34; appeared around the center of the explosion about 130 m high. This collar propagated radialy about 20 to 40 m/s to form a tsunami. Meanwhile the pyroclastic jets reached their maximum height of 1 km and collapsed back into the lake to produce a base surge. The interaction between the base surge and the lake water contributed to the formation of complex waves. \r\n<p>\r\nThe steep northern shore of the lake was violently eroded by the tsunamis and surges, with all plants and soil less than 1.5 m thick stripped off, and poorly consolidated bedrock exposed. Along the rest of the shoreline, more than 1.3 km from the crater, the tsunamis carved new cliffs two to three\r\nmeters high, eroded the layer of frozen soil up to 50 cm thick, and removed the vegetation. The tsunamis deposited several discontinuous, finely laminated layers of sand and gravel up to 35 cm thick, with scattered pebbles, and fragments of plants. The strongest event produced the highest runup of 30 m on the shore 700 m from the center of the crater. At the most distant points (1.3 km from the crater) the runup was two to three meters.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #1315)\r\n</p><p> The highest runups (20-30 m) occur on the shore immediately adjacent to the tuff ring, 700 m from the center of the crater.

On the night of the eruption there were reports of a wave inundating the Old Road Bay area, 10 km from the landslide site. A small tsunami was generated, probably by the steep flow front of the debris avalanche, possibly assisted by the pyroclastic flows as they entered the sea at the mouth of the White River Valley. The tsunami wave was refracted around the coastline of Montserrat,and achieved considerable run-up in Old Road Bay. The wave was estimated to have been about 1 m higher than the road which lies 2-m above water level, and to have moved inland a maximum distance of 80 m. A variety of objects, including a small wooden boat, a roof to a shelter, and a stone table were displaced several meters inland and a large log was carried even further by the wave. Impact marks up to 1 m were also on the side of palm trees facing the sea. The grass was oriented in such a way as to indicate the retreat of the wave. An observer reported seeing the sea move out and then back in, which is typical of a landslide-generated tsunami.(reference #1315)",

Suddenly, at 21:3O, the sea became very rough, with enormous whirlpools. All this was like a heavy surf on shore and instilled fear. Water fell on the deck with heavy blows. The keel rocking was such that the compass card flew off its point. The troughs which formed on the surface of the sea appeared to the eye to reach a depth of 4 m. Especially strong waves came from the north. The stormy sea lasted until 9:45 [21:45?], but came to an end completely by 10:00. Any surge had completely disappeared by 12:00. The pressure and temperature of the air varied negligibly during this phenomenon.  Redetermination of the location of the ship showed that on that day it was situated in the zone of a western stream with a speed of about 2 knots. (reference #414)"

Mr. Forrest was formerly a missionary belonging to the Melanesian Mission, and settled in the Santa Cruz islands. Some time ago he resigned from the mission, and took up commercial pursuits, island life having an attraction for him.  As the group is comparatively seldom called at by passing vessels news rarely reaches Sydney from there; but the Ysabel pays Mr. Forrest&#39;s station a visit about four times a year.  She was there nearly three months ago and will return on her next outward trip from Sydney about a week hence. Mr. Forrest has written to Mr. Mitchell, of Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Co. an account of a phenomenal experience he had in the <b>latter part of March</b>. It was a sudden outbreak of a volcano, which was followed by an overwhelming tidal wave.  Santa Cruz Islands, seven in number, are notable as being the scene of the disastrous loss of the two ships Boussole and Astrola, of La Perouse, in 1788, an event which was not ascertained with any certainty until May, 1826, or 38 years afterwards. Santa Cruz Island [Nendo Island], on which Mr. Forrest resides, is the principal of the group, and it was here that natives attacked the boats of H.M.S. Pearl, under Commodore Goodenough, in August, 1875, and with their poisoned arrows fatally wounded the much respected Commodore. Mr. Forrest describes how the volcano burst forth with smoke and flame, emitting ashes, and all but ruining his plantations. At night there was a fearful roar out to seaward, and soon after a huge sea broke on the coast, smashing his trading craft into splinters, washing away the copra-house and demolishing his store of copra and cocoanuts, completing in fact the work of destruction left unfinished by the seismic disturbance. At the time of writing Mr. Forrest was not informed of what loss of life inland amongst the natives as a result of the eruption had taken place or what the effect of the tidal wave had elsewhere been on the Santa Cruz coast, but he fears, as the island is thickly populated, some fatalities have happened. The group is a volcanic one, and before contained an active volcano upon an uninhabited island not far from Santa Cruz. (reference #11695)</p>",

It has been there since 1740 and now is Greenland&#39;s most popular tourist destination thanks to the gorgeous Ilulissat Icefjord (tourism is the town&#39;s principal industry). All of which brings us to Jens Muller who is a Greenland native but from another community.\r\nHe recently posted a most interesting video of an event that happened on a beautiful, sunny day in Greenland; an event that easily could have cost him and two others their lives. Jens picks it up from there. &#34;A tourist from Australia came to my uncle and asked if she could get a ride to the glacier just north of Ilulissat, Greenland, so he asked me if I wanted to be his translator. I am from another town where glaciers are fairy tales, I was as much of a tourist as the Australian tourist, so I decided to join the crew. The beautiful scenery was amazing, but the nature doesn&#39;t care about anyone. That day almost became our last day.&#34; So it was Jens, his uncle and the Australian tourist in the small boat that drove out to the big glacier that everyone wants to see. The glacier flows at a rate of 65 to 115 feet per day, resulting in around 20 billion tons of icebergs calving off and passing out of the fjord every year. Icebergs breaking from the glacier are often so large (up to 3,300 feet in height) that they are too tall to float down the fjord and instead lay stuck on the bottom of its shallower areas, sometimes for years, until they are broken up by the force of the glacier and icebergs further up the fjord. As Jens was filming the glacier and the beauty of the surroundings, that is when it happened. A massive portion of the glacier calved off and dropped into the sea; a big enough piece that it generated a huge wave.\r\n(reference #9925)\r\n<p>It&#39;s unclear when the footage was shot but it was uploaded yesterday [July 19, 2012] by a man from Greenland who goes by the username Barbecueengineer.

There was a multiple eruption of the Miyejin submarine volcano (31 deg 56.7 min N., 140 deg 0.5 min E.) 130 km south of Hachijo Island. The augite-hypersthene-dacite composition of the lavas determined the explosive nature of the eruptions. All the explosions were well recorded by the hydrophones of the American SOFAR system, including those on the coast of California. Some of the eruptions were observed visually from ships and airplanes by Japanese specialists. Thus, during the weak eruption of September 23 at 13h 40m, a water dome, with protuberances 600-800 m high and 2 km in diameter, arose over the volcano. No seaquake was felt, but waves 50 m long and 2 m high spread over the sea surface. During the stronger eruptions weak tsunamis were generated, 52 of which were registered by the tide gauge on Hachijo Island. The strongest of these waves were also registered by tide gauges on Jogashima Island and Cape Omae on the south coast of Japan. The travel time of the waves to Hachijo Island was about 30 minutes, the period 1.5 minutes, the height 10-90 cm. In the nature of dispersion and other parameters, the waves corresponded to theoretical Cauchy-Poisson waves from an initial impulse with a source diameter of 2 <u>&#43;</u> km. Some waves were like pulses. This was apparently due to the interference of waves bending around both sides of Aoga-shima Island, midway between the volcano and Hachijo Island. \r\n</p><p>The tsunami of September 26 was recorded in Hilo, in the Hawailan Islands with an amplitude of less than 0.1 m. \r\n</p><p>The ship &#34;Kiyo Maru No 5&#34; of the Japanese hydrographic service, which had come out to study the eruption, was lost in the eruption of September 24.</p>",

The landslide and flood at Vaiont Reservoir in northeast Italy is a famous engineering disaster caused by the failure to manage the effects of reservoir filling upon the stability of Monte Toc, just to the south. The disaster was unusual in that dam collapse did not trigger the ensuing flood. Rather, a catastrophic landslip from the slope of Monte Toc pushed ~1/5 of the water in the newly created reservoir overtop and around the dam. The 2.6x10<sup>8</sup> m<sup>3</sup> slide mass flung down 30 million cubic meters of water to flood the Piave Valley below. \r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #10992:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>1963, October 9. The Vajont Landslide occurred at 10.39 pm in Italy, in the Dolomites of Friuli, on the borders of the Veneto Region and about 100 km north of Venice. A mass of approximately 270-300 million m<sup>3</sup> of rock and debris collapsed into the reservoir generating a wave that over-topped the 261.6 m high double curved arch dam built across a V-shaped gorge. The flood wave dropped into the Piave Valley destroying the town of Longarone and other villages nearby. <b>More than 2,000 people (the real number is not known) were killed</b>.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #10993:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>1963, October 9. At 22:39 a huge landslide of about 270 million m<sup>3</sup> slid from Mount Toc into the Vajont artificial reservoir, in north-eastern Italy. The amount of water in the basin at that moment was about 115 million m<sup>3</sup>. The resulting displacement of water caused the generation of an impulse wave that spread throughout the basin. Its impressive wave run-up on the north slope of the lake, in front of Mount Toc, reached and <b>damaged buildings located in Casso</b> about 235 m over the original height of the lake surface. The resulting wave rundown crashed into the front of the landslide and partially crossed over the slide bulk, reaching the depressions behind the slide. On the east side of the basin, a portion of the water which was pushed forward by the landslide formed a wave with smaller amplitude that travelled to the east, reaching the eastern most end of the reservoir in the mountains. \r\n</p><p>During the whole event several impulse waves crested the dam or moved onto the surrounding slopes which became a way for the water to move out into the narrow canyon that connects the dam to the Piave Valley. The mass of water that poured into the canyon, compressing the air, generated a wave of pressure that acted as a wind. This &#34;wind&#34;, propagating at a speed greater than the waterfront, preceded the waterfront and produced the first damage in Longarone, before the water reached the town. The villages located along the Piave riverbed were completely devastated and turned into a flat plain of mud, with about 1700 casualties. The wave travelled upstream for about 5 km and in the downstream cross-sections of Ponte nelle Alpi and Belluno (located respectively at about 11 and 19 km from Longarone) the estimated maximum flow was 20% - 50% higher than the one observed during the famous 1966 flood wave. \r\n</p><p>The water depth of the wave in some points exceeded 50 m.  \r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #10995:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>1963, October 9.

Very strong underground shocks occurred in the regions of Friuli and Veneto at short time intervals between 20h and 20h30m; each of them lasted approximately 10sec and was accompanied by a loud underground rumble. Nothing but debris remained of the castle and an old extension of the church of S. Giovanni in Udine. The earthquake caused destruction in Cividale del Friuli, Madonna del Lanto, Faedis, Venzone, Tarcento, Tolmino and many other places. Rock falls occurred in the mountains near Gemona, and the River Livenza stopped flowing for a moment. Some old sources of water in the pleistoseistal area dried up, and new sources appeared. The earthquake was felt in Venice, Padua, Treviso, and in other places. The macroseismic epicentre was possibly located between Gemona (del Friuli) and Tolmino. 4-5 shocks more were felt at night, but they were weaker and shorter than the former.\r\n<p>Rollers appeared in the sea. They grew with such a roar that the citizens of Trieste, frightened by this phenomenon, were forced to leave their dwellings and to hide on the hill near the castle. In the Lagoon of Venice the water rose in canals up to the windows of the buildings [Baratta, 1901, 1936; Radics, 1902; Caloi et. al., 1970;  19841.

In addition to this, with reference to a source of the 16th century, data were given on the fact that during the earthquake in Venice the water went away far from the coast, and some fairly deep canals dried up. At the same time, the authors of the paper, on the basis of the absence of destruction and victims in Venice, believed that the estimate of the tsunami intensity should be reduced. \r\n</p><p>(above from reference #2130).\r\n</p><p>1511, March 26. 46<sup>o</sup>12&#39;N, 13<sup>o</sup>26&#39;E, earthquake magnitude 6.5, intensity IX, tsunami intensity 2, reliability 2.

The agitation of the Thames is reported by Churchyard (1580) and others. In the English Channel, it was worse. At Sandwich, &#34;the sea so foamed, that the ships tottered&#34; (Stow, 1601). One contemporary account suggests that marine effects were more severe on the other side of the Channel. &#34;In Calais .. . there was such a horrible and fearful trembling that a great part of the houses collapsed and even the sea flooded into the town . .. In Boulogne there was a similar earthquake and flooding by the sea&#34; (Discours d&#39;une ... , 1580). This may be a seismic sea-wave, but unfortunately there is some doubt about the time, and therefore about the actual relationship between earthquake and marine incursion. Elsewhere in the same document we find it stated that on the 7th April between 4 and 5 a.m. (which coincidentally is the time of the third Kent aftershock) &#34;there occurred in these places great signs of floods&#34;. (reference #3945)</p><p>Varley (1996) states categorically that the earthquake produced a tsunami (which he refers to as a tidal wave) at Calais, Boulogne and Dover. Neilson et al (1984) are more cautious, considering that due to uncertainty about the coincidence in time of inundation and earthquake, the flooding report may have had some other cause (presumably meteorological). Melville et al (1996) are dismissive of the idea of a tsunami from this event. Evidence suggests (Melville et al 1996) that contemporary sources conflated descriptions of the earthquake with the effects of a storm that occurred very shortly afterwards. This is all the more likely since at this period it was not known that earthquakes were very short-lived phenomena, and to a 16th century writer it would have been natural to consider the seismic shock and a storm a day later as being part of the same occurrence. Undoubtedly the earthquake caused agitation of the water in harbours at Dover and Sandwich harbours (Neilson et al 1984). <strong>It is most likely that this movement was a seiche and not a tsunami</strong> as there is no evidence of any seabed displacement in the area and the strength of the earthquake (5.8 ML (Musson, 1994)) was insufficient to cause a tsunami directly.

The epicenter is believed to be 40 km SE of Chittagong, or 61 km N of Cox&#39;s Bazaar, or 257 km SE of Dhaka, Bangladesh. The shock caused severe damage at Chittagong and other areas on the eastern seaboard of the Bay of Bengal. The Arakan coast was elevated for more than 160 km. The quake also caused a tsunami in the Bay of Bengal. The water in the Hoogly River in Kolkata rose by two meters. The rise in the water level at Dhaka was so sudden that hundreds of boats capsized and <strong>many people were drowned</strong>. This is the earliest well-documented tsunami in the Bay of Bengal. (reference #2771)</p><p>In the Bay of Bengal, the historical reports of the tsunami generated by the 1762 earthquake along the Arakan coast of Myanmar are limited to observations of large bores along the Hoogly and Greater Ganges Rivers, over 100 km inland from the coast. These observations may suggest a very large tsunami impacted the coast of Bangladesh at the time, but there appear to be no direct observations of this coastal impact. (reference #2725)</p><p>Cummins suggests that the 2nd April 1762 along the Arakan Coast, generated a megatsunami and flooded the northern Bay of Bengal particularly Bangladesh coast. Cummins provided a geophysical analysis of the tectonic environment of the northern Bay of Bengal suggesting it has a favourable environment to produce great tsunamigenic earthquake similar to the other subduction zones. Cummins referred to the 1762 earthquake which generated a tsunami and flooded the northern Bay of Bengal region. Alam et al. confirmed that the 1762 Arakan Subduction Zone (ASZ) earthquake, further north than the epicentre of the 2004 IOT, also generated a tsunami. (reference #12149)</p><p>Local tsunamis were observed in three places - Bansbaria, Baharchhara and Burumchhara following the earthquake. It is possible that the earthquake generated several sediment slides in the northern BoB, generating tsunamis in Chittagong. Another possibility was that earthquake-induced subsidence, adjacent to the BoB, caused local tsunamis. (reference #10845)</p><p>The earthquake probably generated several submarine sediment slides that triggered local tsunamis which struck the Chittagong coast in Bangladesh. It is also possible that the earthquake induced subsidence and local tsunamis on the Chittagong coast. The locations of tsunamiaffected areas (i.e. Bansbaria, Bharchhara and Burumchhara) are scattered along the Chittagong coast. (reference #12584)</p>",

Magnitude 7.5, Guam Island. There was a destructive earthquake on the Mariana Islands. A tsunami occurred. [The tsunami was generated by an earthquake on the 24th or the 25th.] One of the eyewitnesses, who was on board a ship riding in the bay, gave the following account of the effects of the main earthquake and the tsunami in Umatac Bay: &#34;The first, main earthquake began with an exceptional trembling of the water, which was then transmitted to the land. The displacements of the ground were so large that all stone and brick buildings suffered to some extent, and many completely collapsed. One of my boats were taking on a supply of water in the mouth of the river. It was caught by the flood tide, and almost tossed on to the trees. Barrels and other objects were carried 1/2 km (1/4 mile) or more from the shore to open sea. When the wave rolled back, hundreds of fishes were left on the dried bottom. The shore near the river dropped about 3 1/2 m (12 feet). The wave entrained the ship with such force, that it could not hold to its anchors. The water ran up onto the island in an east-west direction. A mild northeasterly wind was blowing.&#34;\r\nIn the Inarajan region (southeast coast), a woman was caught up by the wave near the Talofofo River, and never reappeared.

On Camiguin Island there was a\r\ndestructive earthquake, which devastated the extreme northern part of the island and which was felt on the islands of Mindanao, Bohoi, Cebu and others. Many wooden homes were destroyed and massive stone walls collapsed at Mambajao and Catarman; many avalanches occurred in the mountains. Many more shocks were registered almost daily until April 30. Four of these were strong, and were felt almost the same as the main earthquake (Maso, 1910 a).\r\n</p><p>On April 30, the Hibokhibok Volcano (Camiguin Island), which had been considered extinct, exploded and a new crater was formed at its foot. Maso (1911 b), describes the events as follows.\r\n</p><p>On April 30, at 7:00, a new volcano exploded with a terrifying roar on the north-northeast tip of the island. A column of steam, stones and ash rose into the air; the ash fell for a distance of up to 200 km from the volcano. Everything was destroyed in a radius of 2-3 km from the new crater. There were no victims, since the residents of the nearest settlement, Catarman, frightened by the earthquakes, had left their homes before the eruption. The underground shocks stopped almost completely for several days after the eruption.\r\n</p><p>Fuchs (1872) describes the eruption somewhat differently.\r\n</p><p>On April 30 (or May 1), the plain at Catarman settlement began to subside gradually, so that the roofs of the homes were soon at ground level. While many residents were observing this phenomenon, suddenly, at 17:00, a terrible roar pealed out, cracks appeared in the ground, and an eruption began from the small crater which had newly appeared in place of the village. A large cloud of smoke rose into the air. Flows of lava and water issued. The explosions, like shots from a large cannon, continued uninterrupted for several hours. Then a brief pause ensued, after which the explosions began again and new subsidences occurred, and lava again flowed from the crater, flooding the huts in its path and falling with a terrible hiss into the sea. A dense cloud of ash hung over the island. Shafts of flame from the volcano burst through the dark ash. The eruption lasted a long time.\r\n</p><p><b>The population of 26,000 people fled the island; it was inundated by a wave from the sea</b>.\r\n</p><p>Perrey (1875) gives a fuller description of the eruption, but says nothing about a tsunami.</p>",

It was felt strongly by vessels offshore at Panama City, but no anomaly was observed at the tide gauge on Isla Naos (Pacific side). The cable between Colon and Jamaica broke, which suggests a submarine landslide that might have been caused by the earthquake. A 3m tsunami affected the San Blas Coast of Northern Panama; between 75 and 100 were drowned (reference #273).\r\n<p>1882, Sept. 7, about 3:00 [local time]. There was an earthquake at Panama, stronger than any previously known. Sieberg (1932), in giving the basic data on the earthquake, reports that it was accompanied by tsunami waves which were observed from Panama to Guayaquil [source of information unknown]. Iida (reference #79) surmises, without much evidence, that two earthquakes occurred: one in Panama and Nicaragua, the other in Colombia. [&#34;Tsunami wave in Guayaquil&#34; is an incorrect translation of &#34;Seismic wave down to Guayaquil&#34; in Sieberg, reference #1576, listed below] (reference #415)\r\n</p><p>1882, Sept. 7. Destruction in the city of Panama, several deaths. Also felt on the islands and a tsunami. Cable breaks. Damage suffered the landward towns, even Colon. Felt in Nicaragua to Greytown, North Colombia and Venezuela to Caracas. Seismic wave down to Guayaquil. Numerous, partly final aftershock to 1883. (ref #1576).\r\n</p><p>A large tsunami associated with the earthquake swept the San Blas Islands in northern Panama on 7 September 1882, killing about 65 people (Star and Herald, 1882; Nelson, 1889). A newspaper article that appeared in the Star and Herald (1882) of Panama City on 11 October 1882 contains a firsthand account of the tsunami damage. The article is based on details provided to the governor by one of the island inhabitants and contains the following statements:\r\n&#34;. . . the tide ran out a great distance, and on its return, swept away the villages built on the beaches of the different islands of the archipelago and on the mainland. The outflow and inflow occurred four times a day, the greatest damage being done by the third wave. The villages of Rio Coco, Isla Paloma, Napacandi, on the islands of the same name, were swept away, and more than forty persons were drowned. At Playon Grande, every house was washed down,\r\nbut only two persons were drowned. Playon Chico, which adjoins it, also suffered. All the produce stored at Rio Mono was swept away, but no lives were lost. The chief loss of produce, however, has taken place at Aguili Candi island\r\n. . . Sixteen persons lost their lives there, and several thousand dollars worth of imported goods were swept into the sea. The villages of Rio Banana and Mosquito have also been flooded, the people left homeless, and their goods destroyed. &#34;Although the sea was observed to be relatively calm at Colon, the Canal Company tidal gauge located offshore registered a distinct tsunami with a maximum height of 62 cm (Bulletin du Canal Interoceanique, 1882; Nelson, 1889). At Miguel de la Borda, the tide rose and flooded beach houses (Star and Herald, 1882). Because subsidence was extensive in the area, however, the tsunami effects at Miguel de la Borda cannot be accurately estimated. The submarine telegraph cable between Col6n and Jamaica broke during the earthquake (Star and Herald, 1882; De Montessus de Ballore, 1888; Nelson, 1889). (reference #1575)</p>",

Violent earthquakes connected with the zone are those of 1720 Sep. 12, 1783 July 29, 1784 Oct. 14, and 1806 Oct. 6. At Gerace, the earthquake of 1784 was regarded as stronger than the great earthquake of 1783 Mar. 27. \r\n<p>The earthquake of 1907 occurred during an epoch of comparative calm in the whole of Calabria. It was, however, heralded by five shocks within the Gerace zone, on 1905 Sept. 9 and 26, 1906 Jan. 16, 1907 May 25 and Oct. 23, 9.25 p.m. The disastrous earthquake closely followed the last shock, at 9.28 p.m...  \r\n</p><p>The epicentral area, within which the intensity was 9,\r\nwas very small, and included only one town (Ferruzzano), where many houses collapsed almost completely, and <b>158 persons, or 8% of its population, were killed</b>. How rapidly the intensity declined outwards is evident from the fact that at Bruzzano Zefferio, only 13 miles from Ferruzzano, no houses were ruined and no lives were lost. The total disturbed area was about 41,000 sq miles.\r\n</p><p>In the central area, the shock lasted from 1O to 12 sec. The movement was continuous throughout, and varied but s1ightly in strength.\r\n</p><p>Though perfectly calm at the time of the earthquake, the\r\nsea soon afterwards advanced about 130 yd. over the shore, the seawaves being perceptible along the coast for about six miles from Capo Bruzzano to the river Careri. The waves left traces of their passages on the mareograms at Messina and Catania, the record at the former place being interrupted by the stopping of the driving clock at 9.28 p.m. At Catania, the first movements were recorded\r\nat 9.48 p.m., the last at 6 a.m. on Oct. 24. The amplitude of the largest oscillations was about 4 in.

The sea, which had previously been absolutely calm within the focal area, penetrated deep onto dry land for 30 - 80 m over a distance of 10 - 20 km between Cape Brutzano and the River Careri and then it receded farther than its usual limits.

There was a very strong earthquake in the southern part of Atacama province, with a zone of destruction approximately from Copiapo to Coquimbo. The instrumental and macroseismic epicenters were fixed at sea in the region of Vallenar - Huasco. This tsunami generating earthquake began with relatively weak, but comparatively rapidly intensifying oscillations, lasting from 1/2 to 8 minutes according to different estimates. The earthquake was preceded by strong foreschocks, felt on the 3rd and 7th of November. Seismic activity in the focal zone of the earthquake was high for two months.\r\n<p>At Chanaral, the tsunami began an hour after the earthquake and lasted about 4 hours. The sea surged onshore three times. It rose 9 m above the high tide mark, destroyed 14 homes, and carried four homes inland (there was no destruction resulting directly from the earthquake here). The tides were calm, but prolonged.\r\n</p><p>At Caldera the sea at first remained completely calm after the earthquake, but then it rose: 15 minutes, 30 minutes, or 45 minutes after the earthquake, according to different estimates. The most reliable in this respect, is the report of a witness, who at the time of the earthquake was on a ship riding in the harbor, and who set off for the port in a boat immediately after the strong shocks had ceased. When the boat arrived at shore 15 minutes later, the water had risen about 5 m above the high tide level and almost splashed over the moorage.\r\n</p><p>At Coquimbo, the sea was absolutely quiet before the earthquake. About 2 hours after the earthquake, a tsunami appeared. The waves spread from the northeast to the southwest along the axis of the bay, passed along the western and eastern shores, but did not cause any damage. On the south shore, the water rose to a considerable height. Three large tidal waves were observed, the third being the most destructive. The water penetrated 2 km at the most low-lying places, and the rise was 5 m above the maximum high tide line or 6 m above the mean sea level. It reached 7 m above mean sea level at the railway quay. The water rose and fell slowly; the ebb was smaller than the flood; the surface of the water was calm. As a result, the part of the city situated at the southern apex of the Bay was totally destroyed, not alone by the water, but also by boats and other objects which it carried.\r\n</p><p><b>Several hundred people drowned in the waves.</b>\r\n</p><p>The tsunami was also observed at Huasco, Antofasgasta, Callao, San Felix and San Ambrosio Islands.

The tsunami arrived at Apia (Samoa Islands) in 14.1 hours. At Pago Pago on Tutuila Island the period of oscillations was 20 minutes.

The earthquake triggered a large submarine slump (an estimated volume of 200 cubic km of material was moved on the Laurentian slope) which ruptured 12 transatlantic cables in multiple places, and generated a tsunami... More than 40 local villages in southern Newfoundland were affected, where numerous homes, ships, businesses, livestock and fishing gear were destroyed. Also lost were more than 280,000 pounds of salt cod. Total property losses were estimated at more than $1 million 1929 dollars. (reference #1827)\r\n<p>A tsunami struck the Burin Peninsula of Newfoundland Nov 18, 1929 after the 1702 NST magnitude 7.2 earthquake occurred in the Laurentian Slope Seismic Zone. This event is Canada&#39;s most tragic earthquake with twenty-eight lives lost. The tsunami swept into the coast of Newfoundland 2.5 hours after the seismic event near the top of a high spring tide. Water levels first fell far below normal then, in three successive waves, that often arrived on shore as breaking waves, water levels rose 2 to 7 m... St. Lawrence at the head of Great St. Lawrence Harbour was one of the communities inundated, fortunately with no loss of life, but with substantial property damage... The map [St. Lawrence] indicates a tsunami height of about 4 m, a runup height of about 13 m and a runup distance of at least 760 m at the head of the harbour... The earthquake shook loose a portion of the continental slope over a 20,000 km2 area and the resulting turbidity current flowed at 70 km/hr to redistribute 200 km3 of material over a 150,000 km2 area on the Sohm Abyssal Plain\u0085 The tsunami created by the Nov 18, 1929 slump on the Laurentian Continental Slope took about 2 hours to reach Bermuda at an average speed of just over 700 km/hr. It took about 2.5 hours to reach the Burin Peninsula of Newfoundland and about 3 hours to reach Cape Breton Island at an average speed of about 144 km/hr... In the case of the 1929 tsunami as it arrived on the Burin Peninsula, in all cases witnesses report it was first seen at about 1930 NST as a major withdrawal (NST is 0.5 hr ahead of AST used in the rest of Atlantic Canada). In the communities of Lamaline, Taylor&#39;s Bay, Lord&#39;s Cove and Port au Bras there are reports of a breaking wave arriving; up to three main pulses were seen. Many smaller pulses of the tsunami continued to affect the area for several hours after the main event. In Burin Harbour, which is quite deep, the tsunami tended to be seen as a very rapidly rising sealevel over about a 5 to 10 minute period, then the sealevel rapidly fell over the same period... The tsunami with its three successive pulses arrived during a high astronomic tide. To make matters worse, the three main pulses arrived over about a half-hour period near the top of a rising (extra high) &#39;spring tide&#39; or during &#34;the springes&#34;. Fortunately it was a bright moonlit and a windless evening; the sea was dead calm, thus there were no storm waves to do extra damage. In addition, the tsunami&#39;s arrival in early evening meant people were up and about and awake to save themselves... Most estimates of the day suggested that the 1929 tsunami elevation was 30 to 50 ft high (9.1 to 15.2 m). In fact, it is doubtful that the tsunami elevation reached more than about 7.5 m above the normal calm sea... (ref #1719)\r\n</p><p>The 1929 Newfoundland tsunami the tsunami wave heights were 3 m in St. Lawrence Bay and 7 m in Taylor&#39;s Bay, but the runup heights at the heads of the bays were about 13 m.

To some observers on vessels lying at anchor 5.5 km from Napier, it seemed as if the city first lifted and then sank after the quake began. The water around the vessels became turbid. </p><p>(Questionable tsunami).\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Ref #11746:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>The 1931 February 02 MS7.8 MW7.4-7.6 Hawke&#39;s Bay earthquake, one of the largest earthquakes in New Zealand&#39;s short historical record and responsible for causing extensive deformation (uplift and subsidence) of the Hawke Bay coastline and several large coastal landslides, caused a relatively small tsunami, except at Waikare Estuary, where a large landslide caused a 15&#43; m surge destroying a farm shed (de Lange &amp; Healy, 1986). No significant tsunami was noticeable along the ocean coast near Napier, nor at the Port of Napier, attributed to the outpouring of water from the Ahuriri Lagoon (Callaghan, 1933; Marshall, 1933). Marshall reported that water in the Ahuriri Lagoon (location not given) rose 0.6-0.3 m above normal tide level. However, this may be attributable to differential uplift across the Lagoon, and/or seiching. De Lange &amp; Healy (1986) also found no compelling evidence of a tsunami along the Napier foreshore, despite Laing&#39;s (1954) report a large wave along Marine Parade and a surge in the inner harbour/Ahururi Lagoon entrance. Considering Callaghan (1933) and Marshall (1933), Laing&#39;s report must be considered erroneous. Marshall&#39;s (1933) report on the coastline from Clifton on the southern shore of Hawke Bay to east of Mohaka, which was examined for evidence of uplift as well as earthquake shaking and tsunami effects, notes very little evidence of tsunami, certainly he mentions no evidence of a large tsunami. The ridges and furrows on the gravel beaches caused by strong shaking were not noted to have been disturbed by waves. Although Marshall (1933) considered at least two of the three large landslides he described from Old Man&#39;s Bluff to the Mohaka River capable of causing a localised tsunami, he gives is no indication that any specifically related to the landslides was observed. Other reports indicate a 3 m surge at Wairoa (de Lange &amp; Healy, 1986), a series of surges and recessions (1-2 m?) at Waikokopu (de Lange &amp; Healy, 1986; Marshall, 1933) and several surges at Clifton (1-2 m?) (Parsons, pers. comm.). De Lange &amp; Healy (1986) discuss Hart&#39;s (1931) evidence that a tsunami was recorded in Sydney, concluding that &#34;Hart&#39;s records must be considered unreliable&#34;. <b>A validity of 4 </b>is assigned to the tsunami, for which the generating mechanisms were deformation and/or coastal landslide, and possibly submarine slumping, although none is specifically mentioned.</p>",

Having in mind that during the same evening heavy rain hit Kos (Manousis 1934; Kasdaglis 1998; various press reports) we concluded that: (1)in the morning of April 23, 1933, when the earthquake struck, the weather was calm, (2)bad weather conditions with strong winds, heavy rain and rough sea prevailed later by the end of the day and during the evening.

The number of homes destroyed directly by the earthquake was 2,598; 1,443 people died. In addition, 1,451 homes were washed away by the ensuing tsunami waves.</p><p>A sizeable tsunami rolled onto the coast of the Kii Peninsula and Shikoku Island. The tsunami was strongest on the east coast of Kii Strait, from Fukuro to Mio, where the rise of water was 6 m. The rise was slightly less on the western coast of the strait, and increased from south to north (from 2-3 to 4.5-5 m). In Tosa Bay, the maximal rise\r\nof water was observed in the Susaki region, where it also reached 5 m, but the impact of the tsunami was considerably weaker here than in the Kii Strait.</p><p>According to visual observations, the first wave was the highest at Sinjo and Kanno&#39;ura, while the second wave was the highest at most other points, and the third was highest far into Susaki Gulf. The records for the tide gauges situated on the eastern shore of the Kii Strait, showed that the tsunami began here with an ebb, which was followed by a large rise in the water level.</p><p>The following is known about the effects of the tsunami at individual points. On both shores of the entrance to Yura Bay (at Katakui, Okui, Kashiwa and west of Kamiya), the rise of water was 2.7-2.8 m. According to residents, the tsunami advanced slowly here, and the water rose gradually; at Katakui, the sea bottom was exposed. East of the Kashiwa-Itoya line, the rise of water increased markedly, reaching 3.9 m at Yura and Fukui, and 4-4.2 m at the head of the bay.</p><p>At Tokushima, the water rose only 1.5 m and the incursion did no damage. The rise of water increased towards the head of Akaishi Bay, which constricts in a southwestern direction. At Komatsushima, it was only 1.7-1.9 m (possibly due to the protection of the breakwater) and at Yokosu, the water did not cross a dike 2 m high, but between Kanaiso and Akaishi, it even flowed across a dike 3 m high. At Akaishi, the water rose 2.8-2.9 m. The tsunami approached Akaishi in the form of a step, and the run-up was rather strong. No little damage was done: dikes were destroyed, homes were flooded, and different objects were carried away.</p><p>At Shishikui, partly screened from the south by a rocky cape, the rise of water on shore was 3.3 m. Protective tree stands, planted along the coast, somewhat weakened the thrust of the water, and for the most part it overflowed along the mouth of the Shishikui River. The broken surf rose up river. On the south side of this cape, the rise of water was 4.4 m. At Kanno&#39;ura, situated somewhat to the west, the rise of water was rather high, but the coast did not suffer, except for the top of a little bay which constricts to the north. The ships in the harbor did not run aground which indicates the low speed of currents at the steep and deep shore.</p><p>At Kanno&#39;ura and at Cape Muroto, according to accounts, the movement of the water began with an ebb tide. Muroto Port dried up as far as the breakwater. At Cape Muroto, both the rise of water and the wave periods were less than on other sections of the coast. At Kochi, a large area of the subsided shore was flooded with water, but the tsunami itself was very weak. The tsunami practically did not enter Urado Bay which has a narrow, long and very shallow entrance.</p><p>The tsunami was registered far from the source, on the coast of the Hawaiian Islands and North and South America.</p><p><i>See individual runup locations for more information.</i>.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #150:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>Lists 1,362 deaths, 11,661 houses destroyed, 1,451 houses washed away, 2,598 houses burned down.\r\n</p><p>View a calculated <a href=\"http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/seg/hazard/tsu_travel_time.shtml#Honshu1946\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">tsunami-travel-time map</a>.</p>",

The flow of the water network increased for the next 3-4 h. The sea between Chios and Cesme turned red in colour and became turbid for a few hours. Hot natural springs disappeared in Karaburun, re-emerging later in different locations. The sea attacked the coasts of Cesme town, leaving many dead fish behind after it subsided. Fishermen are reported to have described flames spurting out of the sea surface (Cumhuriyet, 24 July 1949).

It reached the nearest coasts of the islands of Shikoku and Kyusllu approximately 20 minutes after the earthquake. On the average, the range of the oscillations in sea level on these coasts was 2-2.5 m. The greatest rise of water, 3 m\r\nor somewhat more, was resgistered on Shikoku Island at \r\nUrashiri and Komame; here the water flooded across the protective dikes and caused destruction. At most points, however, the oscillations in level did not exceed the regular flood and ebb oscillations. The tsunami, on the basis of visual observations, began with a flood tide almost everywhere. The first or the second wave was the highest. As a rule, the water level rose quietly, and strong currents arose only in narrow straits. The mean period of oscillations was close to 20 minutes.\r\n</p><p>The tsunami was registered clearly by the tide gauges on the southern coast of Japan. The tsunami begins with a flood tide on all the tide gauge records. However, on the records of the instruments set up on Shikoku Island, the height of the first trough is approximately twice as great as the height of the first crest. For this reason, it has been surmised that there were subsidences of the floor in the southern part of the source of the tsunami, while elevations of the floor predominated on the whole at the source. According to Hatori, the vertical displacements of the sea bottom at the source of the tsunami were about 20 cm, and the energy of the tsunami was 1.3 X 10<sup>20</sup> ergs. According to Aida, a comparatively uniform elevation of the bottom by 30-35 cm took place at the source, and the energy of the tsunami was (1.4-2.2) X 10<sup>19</sup> ergs. It is conjectured that the earthquake was a consequence of gently sloping overthrust in a west to east direction. \r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #45:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>A 2.3 meter tsunami was generated on the east of Kyushu.

The nearest towns, about 70 km away from the epicenter, are rural municipalities of the provinces of N. and E. Samar.<p>Recent investigations done in 2009 disclosed eyewitnesses from the E. Samar towns of Can-avid, San Policarpo and Taft for this particular earthquake. In San Policarpo, which is about 50 km from epicenter, the tsunami was observed after strong shaking by two individuals who were 11 and 13 years old at that time. The eyewitnesses were Mr. Cesar Moratal and Ms. Fe Moratal who are from Bgy Binogawan. They mentioned that it was high tide at that time and after the shaking they noticed that the sea receded by as much as 50 m and then went back slowly and flooded the shore by as much as 60 m inland. </p><p>In Can-avid which is about 68 km from the epicenter, the tsunami was observed by Mr Zosimo Miso who was 11 years old when the earthquake happened. He was in their barangay (Bgy Rawis) when, after the shaking, he saw waves about 2.5 m high which inundated as far as 120 m inland. </p><p>Other eyewitnesses interviewed were from the town of Taft, which is about 78 km from the epicenter. The Taft eyewitnesses interviewed by Joan Salcedo, Vilma Hernandez and Nolan Evangelista in 2009 were Ms Ana Apable who was 34 years old when the tsunami occurred, Mayor Francisco Adalim who was 19 years old and municipal planning officer Roberto Hilario who was 8 years old when the tsunami occurred. Ms Apable stated that while on a banca on Taft River, she felt a strong water oscillation and observed strong water current. Then she observed rise in water level which lowered immediately. Later, fish were found on the canals inland. Meanwhile, Mayor Adalim observed people running in panic during the earthquake, then almost knee-high sea water entered the plaza area. Mr Hilario noted that height was greater than 1.5 m and that there were 3 waves. </p><p>Hatori (1994) also gave a tsunami magnitude of 2 for this event and attributed one death to this earthquake although none of the above accounts mentioned any death.</p><p>Tsunami probability ranking is &#34;positive&#34;.

One hundred fatalities were due to the tsunami, four from the earthquake in Japan. There was extensive damage to ships, roads and houses amounting to about 800 million dollars. (reference #1315)\r\n<p>The earthquake generated a tsunami that began striking the Japan coast approximately 12 minutes after the earthquake occurred. One hundred lives were lost as a consequence of the tsunami alone. The tsunami also caused significant flooding and property damage to coastal\r\nregions. The tsunami affected the entire Japan Sea, hitting the surrounding coastline of the Korean Peninsula and the USSR. Three lives were lost in South Korea, when the wave arrived there approximately 1-1/2 hours after the earthquake... Clearly, most of the impact occurred north\r\nof the Oga Peninsula, where a maximum run-up of 14.9 m was recorded... Significant wave run-up was also observed along the Korean coast... A maximum run-up of 3.2 m was followed by a run-down of -5.6 m [Port of Imweon]. Most of the impact of the tsunami in South Korea occurred between Imweon and Sogcho.. During the tsunami, 100 individuals were drowned, most of them at Noshiro, Hachimori, and the Oga Peninsula. These individuals were caught on the shoreline or on offshore construction sites. Tsunami\r\nwarnings were issued approximately 14 minutes after the earthquake occurred; however, the leading wave reached the shoreline at these locations at approximately the same time.\r\nIn Korea, three deaths were attributed to the tsunami. Since the tsunami reached the Korean shoreline approximately 1-1/2 hours after the earthquake occurred, these deaths could have been prevented... In Korea, over 70 ships were damaged by the tsunami... Many coastal flood protective structures were severely damaged during\r\nthe tsunami. For example, concrete armor units weighing 4 metric tons were moved hundreds of feet inland near the area of maximum run-up. In addition, many levees and seawalls were overtopped and damaged. These protective structures were designed for storm waves and were unable to accommodate the waves produced by the tsunami. (reference #149)</p>",

(reference #1315)\r\n<p>In barangay Santa Fe, Caraga, the residents saw the sea retreat by about 50 meters offshore.  This was followed by the onrush of waves which carried them for about two minutes. The impact of the onrushing wave was so strong that it uprooted a shallow, 4-m tall coconut palm tree standing along the shore. Six fishermen each aboard their fishing boats were washed ashore. Meanwhile, several boats located along the coast were destroyed by the oncoming giant waves.  In sitio Bunga of the town of Manay, 12 stilt houses were destroyed by a 5-meter high tsunami near the shoreline. The residents recounted that they observed a series of at least three tsunami waves (the third being the tallest) coming in quick succession in less than a minute of time interval. Based on the extent of dead vegetation and sand distribution in the sloping parts of the area, the estimated height could have been 3-5 m. (reference #10958)\r\n</p><p>1992, May 17. Recent field investigations showed that\r\ntsunami intensity generally decreases southwards and northwards relative to Bunga and Zaragoza areas. There was an unusually high tsunami wave height (~6m) at Bunga that\r\nwas most probably due to local site effect. Tsunami waves were generally preceded by the lowering of sea water level while the tsunami arrival times have some variation particularly in Bobon and Panompon. The period of the tsunami wave was quite difficult to determine because of sketchy details and so much variation in terms of the number of waves that attacked the areas investigated.\r\nIn terms of regional and local geomorphological effects, the 1992 event caused very minor changes. Tsunami sediments were dumped in very few places. It was noted that the coral reefs located between 100-250m from the shore of eastern Mindanao were the coastal features that most probably attenuate the effects tsunami. Local subsidence was likewise observed west of the affected areas.\r\n(reference #2946)</p>",

The sound warned people of the impending tsunami danger; mare lives would have been lost if it had not been heard.

In Peru, damage from the tsunami was limited to the south-central portion of coastline from the town of Atico in the north to Matarani in the south. The area surrounding the city of Camana was hit hardest by the waves. Camana is a popular summer resort of around 53,000, 560 miles south of Lima. Here, maximum runup measurements exceeded 7 meters in some locations, with greater than 1-km inundation in some places. According to reports, 2,000 hectares of agricultural land were inundated in Camana. The tsunami swept over the town, and its surrounding rice and sugarcane fields. About 26 people are known to have perished as a result of the tsunami, with roughly 70 missing. The death toll would have been higher had the event not occurred during the Southern Hemisphere winter when the beaches are nearly empty. (reference #1315)\r\n<p>2001, June 23. Demographic information on earthquake\r\nvictims compiled by the Instituto Nacional de Defensa Civil suggests that most of the victims of ground-shaking damage were the young or the elderly. However, about a third of the tsunami victims were between 30 and 50. No demographic\r\ninformation was available for the 52 persons listed as missing, but anecdotal evidence gathered by the\r\nreconnaissance team indicated that most were farmers working in the onion fields. The normal Saturday work shift ended at 4:00 pm, and before their shift ended. (reference #1373)\r\n</p><p>At most sites estimates of both inundation\r\nand runup were obtained. The highest runup measured\r\n(8.8 m) was on the narrow beach at Playa Chira, where the coastal platform narrows to less than 500 meters and eyewitnesses described splashing of the waves against the cliffs. (reference #4279)\r\n</p><p>As a coseismic effect, a local tsunami was generated, which after 15 min, caused the flood and destruction of the beach resorts of Camana and resulted in the death of 25 people and 62 missing persons. (reference #12809)\r\n</p><p>While, in the most populated beaches such as El Chorro, La Punta and Las Cuevas, it caused the total destruction of 3,500 buildings of noble material and moderate damage in another 1000 approximately, the same ones that in greater numbers were used in the summer periods. As a result of the tsunami, 23 people died in the town of Camana and another 64 were reported missing. The economic losses in this town have been considerable since its entire population subsists on agriculture and commerce. (reference #12813)</p>",

Professor Winthrop reported that &#34;seventy leagues to the east of Cape Ann, the people on board a vessel supposed they had run aground, so violent was the shock, but their lead showed fifty fathoms of water.&#34; Winthrop then stated that word from the West Indies had come that a sea wave of six feet came into Saint Martin&#39;s harbor on the same date. Rothman (Reference #1510) investigated these reports by contacting the embassies of France and the Netherlands, and found the report from St. Martin was erroneous as to date. The Saint Martin effects occurred on November 1, 1755. The report from the vessel&#39;s passengers seems to be a report of the effects of the earthquake on November 18, and not a tsunami.",

An earthquake which affected all of Taiwan Island and caused great destruction, was accompanied by tsunami waves, which ran onto the coast of the island in an east-west direction. Almost the entire island was flooded for a distance of more than 120 km (30 leagues). The tremors and tsunami waves lasted 8 hours. The three main cities of the island and 20 villages were first destroyed by the earthquake and then by the tsunami. Retreating, the water left buildings, at best, as piles of debris. Not a single living soul was left. More than 40,000 residents died.  Many ships were smashed or sunk. In place of the capes, jutting into the sea, which were washed out, fresh scarps and gulfs filled with water were formed. Zelandia Fort (Anpin) and Pingkchingi Fort were washed away together with the hills on which they stood. \r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #150:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>1782, May 22.

Reports from travelers describe a catastrophic tsunami causing up to 40,000 deaths in Taiwan and destroying the forts of Zelandia (presently Tainan) and Pingkchingi (GAZETTE DE FRANCE, 1783), although claims of the island being &#34;nearly entirely covered&#34;&#39; (by water) are clearly fanciful. There is some discrepancy on the date of the event which may also have been accompanied-or triggered-by a volcanic eruption. In the absence of more definitive information on the earthquake\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #10200:</i></blockquote> <p>The validity of this event is highly questionable because the event was totally unrecorded in any Chinese literature, which is virtually impossible due to its significance. From the official dynastic record (National Palace Museum 1982), there was a storm at Taiwan on 2 June 1782. The storm was reported to have induced some damage, but the crop yield of the whole province (including Fujian &amp; Taiwan) was reported to be not affected. Thus, a great disaster occurring in the region during that period was highly unlikely. The casualty claimed (40,000 lives) was approximately 5% of the whole contemporary population of Taiwan, which could have seriously damaged the stability and economy of the society. This event is invalidated due to its unreasonably long period. Even if it is assumed validated, it still could not pass the confirmation.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #12391:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>Around 4th to 5th month, 46th Qianlong year (1781), weather was fine.

He further says that after this disaster the town was transferred to the right bank of the river, to higher and more solid ground, having formerly been on the left bank, on the low marshy soil of the alluvial delta of the river. He expresses doubt of the actual occurrence of an earthquake, and we agree that the sinking was probably due to another cause.

There was a powerful tremor on Umboi Island (Rooke), in the passage between New Guinea and New Britain. A few seconds later, a second, stronger shock knocked down a stove. This was followed by more shocks, but of lesser force. In the morning it was found that large landslides had occurred; cracks 1 m wide had formed in the ground and extended from Nurua village to the sea shore. West of Tolociwa Island (Lotten), a volcano supposedly rose from the water and smoked for a long time. After the tremor, the sea &#34;began to move&#34;. \r\n</p><p>Between 1856 and 1858 in the Miklucho-Maklay coast in Astrolabe Bay. According to local residents, the village of Aralu, situated between the mouths of the Kabenau and Koli Rivers, was destroyed by an earthquake and a subsequent tidal wave. Since this happened at night, only a few men and two women could be saved. They founded a new village, and called it Gambu. A tsunami was observed in Irian Bay. \r\n<br />(Evidently this is the same event as the preceding description.)\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #79:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>1856.

Remarks by de Miklouho-\r\nMaclay, 1884 (ref #12433). Talking about earthquakes, the natives informed me, that on a former occasion, before my arrival on the coast in 1871, a village named Aralu (situated on the coast between the rivers, Kabeneu and Koli) had been completely swept away by the waves after an earthquake. All the huts and the coconut trees surrounding them, were broken down and carried away by the tidal waves, and the inhabitants, men, women and children were drowned (it occurred during the night). A few men belonging to the village and who happened to be away at the time on a visit to some neighbouring village would not attempt to rebuild their huts on the old place, but went to live at Gumbu now Yeimas, also a coastal village but which had escaped destruction being built further inland. The destruction of Aralu was remembered by not very old people and it took place I suppose about the year 1856. The natives on the Maclay-Coast complained about the sickness in the villages on the coast which happened soon after the destruction of Aralu. The sickness amongst them, I believe, was the result of decomposition of animal and vegetable matter left behind on shore after the inundation produced by the high tidal wave, as has been observed, on some islands of the Pacific.</p>",

Submarine cables were again cut, possibly indicating submarine slumping. The steamer, Mariana, 11 km southwest of the Isla Mona Lighthouse, plunged and rolled heavily. Heck reported Oct. 25.

With a lifetime of experience behind him, the old fisherman said in Creole that it was the first time he had ever seen a wall of water come ashore. The tsunami apparently took the lives of at least seven villagers in the town of Petit Paradis, on Haiti&#39;s western coast... For the first time, residents of this coastal village are telling the story of a localized tsunami that hit here immediately after the 7.0 earthquake. The relatively small tsunami reached a few hundred yards into the village, which was devastated by the quake. Steeve Badio is a fisherman here. His house was destroyed, as were the small canoes carved from wood he used to earn a living. &#34;The sea went back,&#34; he explained in Creole. &#34;It sounded like a helicopter ... and then the waves came up,&#34; he said. Badio says the water was higher than the trees, and when it returned back to the ocean, Badio&#39;s father was gone and so were his two nephews: 4-year-old Wolga and 2-year-old James. Badio says they haven&#39;t been able to have a funeral without their bodies.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Ref #1053:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>The waves, which averaged about ten feet (three meters) high, slammed shores along the Bay of Port-au-Prince and the southern coast of the island of Hispaniola (see map), which is shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic.

Tsunami waves were also reported at Jacmel, Les Cayes, Petit Goave, Leogane, Luly and Anse a Galets. The tsunami had recorded wave heights (peak-to-trough) of 12 cm at Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic and 2 cm at Christiansted, US Virgin Islands. \r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Ref #9820:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>The tsunami arrival times recorded by the DART buoy and the Santo Domingo tide gauge indicate that the tsunami on Hispaniola&#39;s south shore was triggered instantly with the earthquake, while the public attention was mostly focused on the Gulf of Gonave and the Bay of Port-au-Prince. The tsunami flooding inside the Gulf of Gonave is attributed to a coastal submarine landslide at Petit Paradis, while the source of the tsunami on the south shore of Hispaniola remains to be determined.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Ref #12693:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>We propose that near-instantaneous dynamically-triggered aftershocks located in the Caribbean Sea \u223c85 km southwest of the mainshock epicenter generated the tsunami south of the island.\r\n</p><p>Small landslides and rock falls occurred along the southern coast of the peninsula both east and west of Jacmel (Harp et al., 2013; Fig. S11), but their contribution to a potential tsunami is unclear. A large (2 km3) deep (3500 m) landslide scar \u223c30 km south of Jacmel was recently suggested to be the source of the tsunami in the Caribbean, but there is no evidence that it was triggered during the 2010 earthquake (Poupardin et al., 2020).</p>",

The New Hebrides Earthquake. The French mail steamer Nera, which arrived at Sydney last night from Noumea, brought further details of the recent severe earthquake in the New Hebrides Group. The volcano at the island of Ambrym suddenly became active, and belched forth enormous quantities of lava, the flames leaping high into the air. Simultaneously the earth began to tremble, and 10 houses were destroyed along the foreshores of the Segond Canal. Several very severe tremors were also felt at Santo Island on two successive days. Houses shook violently and several collapsed. Mrs. Retard was thrown out of her house at Santo and flung against a tree with such force that she was rendered unconscious. Many narrow escapes are reported, but no fatalities. Two children asleep in their cots were rescued from one falling house just in time, and several settlers were struck by flying debris. The steamer Oui Oui and the auxiliary schooner Emille Mercet while at anchor at Malo were struck by a tidal wave caused by the earthquake but although they rolled violently, no serious damage was done.

        "comments": "1831-1834. Burns (1859) records the following: &#34;One morning I was strolling along the beautiful beach in Poverty Bay, admiring the rising sun ... I had not proceeded far before I felt a powerful shock of the earthquake which nearly took me off my feet, rocking the trees to and fro and causing an immense swell in the sea. I knew perfectly well, from experience, that it was not an earthquake, but an electric shock caused by the eruption of a volcano or burning mountain, about 40 miles in the interior of the country; an occurrence not infrequent in those parts ...&#34;. \r\nDespite Burns associating the shock with an eruption, his account clearly describes an earthquake, with an intensity of at least MM6-MM7. His association of the earthquake with the &#34;immense swell of the sea&#34; suggests the two events occurred within short space of time, indicating a local source or seiching caused by surface waves from a more distant large (M&gt;7.5) earthquake. However, seiching is unlikely to occur on the open coast, except within in a confined harbour or estuary, unlikely to be more than a metre and unlikely to initiate the comment &#34;immense swell&#34;. This suggests a local earthquake source within a short tsunami travel time (&lt; 30 minutes), perhaps 50 km from Gisborne. \r\nGiven that &#34;tsunami earthquakes&#34; like the 1947 March and May events (q.v.), which caused only mild shaking, have occurred on this part of the coast, determining an appropriate magnitude for an earthquake large enough to cause a tsunami and close enough for it to arrive within a short time, but only large enough to cause moderate intensities is problematic. However, a large strong shaking plate interface earthquake (magnitude greater than 8 with maximum shaking intensities of MM8 and larger) is not indicated. \r\nAccording to the Dictionary of New Zealand Biography Vol 1, Burns first came to NZ about 1830. A short time after February 1831 he returned to NZ as a trader at or near Mahia. Early in 1832 he moved to inland Poverty Bay, remained a few months only, and then moved to Tolaga Bay where he remained until October 1834, when he permanently left NZ. This indicates the earthquake occurred between 1831 and 1834, not 1832-38 as suggested by Grouden (1966) and later publications based on this data. The date range is not restricted to the time Burns was in Poverty Bay (a few months in 1832) as he may have travelled on occasions to Poverty Bay from Mahia or Tolaga Bay. \r\nA validity of 3 is assigned [tsunami].

The country has issued a tsunami warning, the National Meteorological Agency reported. The shallow quake led to multiple deaths, according to Indonesia&#39;s search and rescue agency. &#34;There are some who have died,&#34; said Heronimus Guru, the agency&#39;s deputy head of operations, as quoted by Reuters. He declined to provide further information. The shallow quake, which hit southwest of the island of Sumatra on Wednesday, had a depth of 24 kilometers (15 miles). The epicenter was located 808 kilometers (502 miles) southwest of Padang. The USGS originally categorized the quake as a magnitude 8.2, and later an 8.1 and a 7.9, before lowering it to a 7.8. Indonesia has issued a tsunami warning for West Sumatra, North Sumatra, and Aceh, according to the National Meteorological Agency.

The Istanbul-based Kandilli earthquake research center said the small &#34;tsunami&#34; pushed sea water up 100 meters (yards) inland. (reference #11848)\r\n<p>A 10 cm tsunami wave was measured at the sea level station in Bodrum. Tsunami was observed in the northern coastal areas. (reference #11849)\r\n</p><p>Kandilli Observatory of Turkey announced that a tsunami in length of 10 cm - which lasted for about 3 minutes - hit the touristic town of Bodrum causing 16 restaurants and shops on the coast to get flooded. (reference #11850)\r\n</p><p>The quake is also believed to have caused a small tsunami in the port of Kos which subsequently suffered extensive damage. The tidal wave was described as being about 70 cm high. (reference #11851)\r\n</p><p>According to findings in field surveys and eyewitness reports, there was almost no significant water motion at the western face of Bodrum peninsula. The tsunami effects were observed at the south coast of Bodrum peninsula only from geographic latitude 27.255E to 27.528E as well as in the northeast coast of Kos Island. The maximum run-up of about 1.9 m was observed at the mouth of a small dry stream (27.407924E, 37.029879N) at Gumbet Bay, which is the most hit area by the tsunami at Bodrum Peninsula. There is an interesting observation that no damage happened in the next bay (Bitez bay at West and Bodrum marina at East of Gumbet bay) which indicates that main impacts of tsunami localized in Gumbet bay. According to the analysis of the records of a security camera at easternmost end of Gumbet bay, sea receded 5 minutes after the earthquake and advanced up to 60m inundation at 13th minute. The run-up traces were found at 2 m elevation (not the inundation border) at Karaada-Black Island (27.461422E, 36.966323N) Kucuk Poyraz bay which is facing the tsunami source area at the epicenter. The tsunami has also been observed at Akyaka village at the eastern end of Gokova bay 80 km away from the epicenter. In Kos, the maximum amplitude of ~1.5 m was observed in the old port of the town, as it comes out from eyewitness accounts, tsunami traces left behind and the analysis of security camera video. In the coast outside the Kos port the tsunami heights did not exceed ~1.0 m. This event occurred in a small area and showed unexpected run-up distribution in the near field area which indicates that the tsunami triggering mechanism is not homogeneous. The event also reminded that the tsunami potential in the eastern Mediterranean is considerable. (reference #11858)</p>",

This event likely originated on the Farallon transform fault, \u223c125 km long, which links the Carmen and Farallon extensional segments of the plate boundary \u223c90 km east of Loreto. The tsunami may imply a vertical component in the motion of the ocean floor or else it possibly was caused by a submarine landslide. However, given the arrival time of the tsunami waves, \u223c1 hr after the mainshock, it is unlikely that the tsunami was triggered by the mainshock.\r\n</p><p>Excerpt of report by Goycoechea, translated:<i>Up to 150 varas [125.7 m] from the seashore, nearly up to the town hall, the earthquake shifted and fissured the ground and opened several holes from which water emanated. There were landslides along the entire mountain range between here and the harbor of La Paz, which caused much noise and crash. After one hour, the sea was several times in motion. It moved outside the shoreline with such a speed that for a moment we thought to become buried by it (without giving us a chance to run to higher ground to avoid becoming a victim), unless, as it was noted, the furious waves moved towards the island located opposite this presidio, which is called del Carmen.

These events were caused\r\nby a meteotsunami driven by convective cells extending from the Bay of Biscay into the English Channel. (reference #10738)\r\n<p>Underwater landslide likely cause of &#39;mild tsunami&#39;, 29 June 2011 Last updated at 06:33 ET. BBC News article. A &#34;mild tsunami&#34; along the South West coast was probably caused by an underwater landslide, a coastal expert has said. The unusual tidal surge struck the Cornwall, Devon, Dorset and Hampshire coastline on Monday morning. There were reports of rivers changing direction, fish leaping out of water and hair standing on end due to static... Roland Stewart from Millbrook, near Plymouth, said: &#34;It was quite violent in a way, my dinghy was moving around with the movement of the water and I just wondered what the hell was going on.... within 15 minutes it was all over.&#34;.. Dr Davidson, an associate professor in coastal processes, told BBC Spotlight: &#34;[Surges] are quite rare and it&#39;s probably not a tidal phenomenon. &#34;It&#39;s probably more likely to be a tsunami of some kind, obviously it&#39;s quite mild. &#34;It&#39;s probably not due to an earthquake, which is the normal source. &#34;It&#39;s probably more likely to be a sub-marine landslide.&#34; According to the Tidal Gauge Anomaly measure, which records the difference between the forecast tide and the actual tide, the anomaly on Monday morning in Newlyn, Cornwall was 0.2m (0.7ft), in Plymouth 0.3m (1ft) and in Portsmouth 0.4m (1.3ft). The MET Office in Exeter said it did not think anything in the weather could have caused the change in the tidal pattern. The British Geological Survey said there was no seismic activity in UK waters over the weekend. (reference #9478)</p>"

A huge rockfall [38 deg 12 min N, 22 deg 12 min E] that came down from the southern coast of the strait without any earthquake caused <b>three waves 3 - 6 m</b> [tsunami intensity 4] high which devastated the southern shore of the gulf from Aiyion to Psathopyrgos and the northern shore from Monastiraki to Doubia. The blows of the first wave were preceded by a rumble. Fishing boats were smashed against coastal rocks along the segment of the southern shore from Selianitika to Lambiri, i.e. at a distance of 3 km on both sides of the estuary of the River Erineos; fish, barrels, pots and pans, and other objects were scattered about in the fields; small flimsily-constructed houses were destroyed; the same\r\noccurred on the segment of the northern shore from Marathias to Trizonia. <b>Two people were drowned and 12 were injured</b>. The waves were especially fierce on Cape Salmenikos near the western coast of the River Erineos. Here, the coastal strip over an area of 55,000 m<sup>2</sup> was submerged between 5 and 44 m. The volume of the landslide was 57,000m<sup>3</sup>. Another landslide (26,000 m<sup>3</sup>) occurred within the river bed. The water flooded the dry land on its western bank over an area of approximately 500 m. Fruit trees were torn out with their\r\nroots, vineyards were ruined on both banks of the river over an area of 150,000 m<sup>2</sup>. The predominant period of the waves was 2 min. The landslide was possibly prepared by seven local earthquakes which had occurred five days before, as well as by heavy rains that accompanied them.

A subterranean rumble was heard the first 3 to 6 m high wave struck, but no shock was felt. From Selianitika to Labiri, each about 3 km distant from the mouth of the Erineos river, fishing boats were crashed on the rocks, fish were found strewn on fields, small houses of very poor construction were destroyed, and barrels, bedsteads and kitchen utensils littered the shoreline. The same occurred on the northern coast of the gulf from Marathia to Trizonia. Two people were drowned and 12 were injured. The waves were particularly severe on the Cape Salmenikos, on the western side of the river, where a coastal strip of about 55,000 square metres slumped 5 to 44 m under the sea. Slump mass: 57,000 cubic meters. Another slump took place in the bed of the river (26,000 cubic meters). On the western side of the river the water entered about 500 m inland.

It inflicted serious damages to structures built close to the seashore, in particular to the local elementary school. The tsunami was generated by the collapse of a basaltic cliff, located 3 km to the southeast of Omoa, along the coastline. The volume of the landslide is estimated to range from 2 to 5 million m<sup>3</sup>, of which 60% fell into the sea. A preliminary simulation of the tsunami provides an acceptable explanation of wave amplitudes, as well as an estimate of the origin time of landslide. The runup height was measured at 4 m at the school, 5 m at the ice-making plant, 5 to 7 m on the northern shore of the river, and up to 8 m immediately north of the launching dock at Pointe Matahumu. South of Omoa Bay, the runup reached 7 m along the elevated shoreline, but only 3 m between the school and Motutapu, an outgrowth of basalt reaching 10 m altitude and protruding 120 m into the sea (220 m at a depth of 10m below sea level).

        "comments": "A localized event of uncertain origin produced three massive waves -- up to 150 m in height -- followed by a series of smaller waves in Lituya Bay.  Possible explanations include a subaerial or submarine landslide, the breaching of a glacial lake, glacial calving, or the sudden surge of a glacier into the bay.  The lack of evidence for a subaerial source suggests the waves resulted from a submarine landslide. Two small buildings were destroyed, three square km of land were inundated, many trees were uprooted, and 50 barrels of salted salmon washed away. (Ref #239)<p> Four witnesses were situated in the Bay: two in a little house on the western side of Cenotaph Island and two on a small ship riding at anchor off the northern shore of the bay, near Fish Lake Island and 2 km west of the above-mentioned little house. According to the fishermen, at approximately 6:20, a dull, continuous rumbling was heard on board the ship. It appeared to come from the mountains located beyond the top of the bay. Because of the darkness, one could not make out what was happening. No tremors were felt. It was flood time. The rumbling lasted approximately until 6:50, when the first large wave appeared in the narrowest part of the bay. It was like a steep watery wall, stretching from shore to shore and having a possible height of 30 m. Espying this wave, the fishermen weighed anchor and headed for Cenotaph Island. When the wave reached them 10 minutes later, they were situated 400 m northwest of Cenotaph Island, at a depth of 20 m. No drop in water level or other anomaly preceded the arrival of the wave. The first wave lifted the ship about 15 m above the normal level. To the north and south, beyond the shelter of the island, the wave may even have been another 15 m higher. Immediately after the passage of this wave, the water surface dropped below the normal level. A boat with a net, riding at anchor off Cenotaph Island at a depth of 14 1/2 m touched bottom. The first wave was followed by a second and third at estimated 2 minute intervals, and each successive wave was larger than the preceding one. After each of these waves, the surface of the water again fell below the normal level. Small waves were observed during the half hour after the passage of the third wave. All the waves were directed towards the exit from the bay. After this, floating tree trunks and pieces of ice appeared around the ship. No surge of water was observed. The fishermen in the little house were awakened at about 7:00 by a noise, like the droning of hundred airplanes flying at low altitude, and found that a wave was approaching their house. Taking to a high safe place, they saw three waves pass the island, growing in height, with a speed of about 20 knots. The maximal height of the waves was estimated at form 45 to 75 m (Reference #415).</p>"

Validity 1 (Reference #239).\r\n<p>1856, July 26. There was a violent eruption in Unimak Pass, apparently near 54 deg 35 min N., 165 deg W. It is described by Neville, the captain of the whaler &#34;Alice Fraser.&#34; Crossing the pass on his ship with six other whalers, he observed that as a result of the volcanic eruption, enormous masses of dense black smoke were rising over the conical peaks of the mountains on the adjacent islands. He and the captains of the other whalers made ready to round the eastern tip of Unalaska Island, in order to get a good look at the eruption, which was accompanied by a prolonged dull roar and tremors, which by that time they had already felt repeatedly. At precisely this instant, the strong breeze which had been blowing completely died down, and the ships found themselves at the mercy of the eruption, in danger of being run aground. The eruption, lasting several hours with variable intensity, then appeared to reach its climax. The thunder of the eruption and the underground rumble rapidly intensified and became ever more ominous. The air was so still that dense black smoke was ejected straight up into the sky, without deviating in the slightest. It spread out above, at cloud level, and ashes, like flakes of snow, fell down in abundance. After 12 hours of still, a light breeze arose from the south, enabling the ships to move away from the volcano. But this breeze carried the column of smoke to the water surface, and a pitch darkness set in over a distance, as was later established, of more than 180 km, and the ships lost sight of the shore. The ashes fell like snow in a blizzard, covering the ships with gray substance from the deck to the top of the masts, blinding and choking all those on deck. Sailing west and north of the eastern shore, the ships tore out of the cloud of smoke. When they were near the northern base of the volcano, a prolonged dull rumble pealed out under them, and an underwater eruption occurred almost right in the centre of the flotilla. First the water churned and began to rise stormily in the form of disorderly waves. Then it rushed up, as if ejected from an enormous spring, forming a dazzling column of water of colossal height, which gradually disintegrated. Then a shaft of fire and smoke rose from the bottom upwards with peals of thunder. Lava and stones from a walnut to a cannon ball in size were disgorged, and fell on deck. This lasted no more than an instant, and the eruption ended as quickly as it had began. The water rushed into the abyss which had formed, forming a colossal whirlpool. The noise was like Niagara Falls. The ships rushed to safety, leaving the volcano in a state of regular alternation of relative calm and eruptions. This event is mentioned very briefly in a number of publications (Reference #414).</p>",

The government awarded them a place to live on the island of Saipan where they settled in the approximate number of 60.

        "comments": "A tidal wave occurred on the north and east coasts of Graham I. at about 02:30 on Tuesday (LT), Mar 28, 1963. The wave coincided with an unusually high tide. In Prince Rupert a high tide of 7.5 m occurred at 03:18 (LT). This was 0.52 m above the predicted tide, and only 0.34 m below the all time recorded extreme high tide.<p>At Wiah Point the wave, or waves, washed over a high water rock, and dislodged two big oil tanks which has been erected there about 30 cm above high water, and washed them onto the shore. The tidal wave that hit the remote west coast of the Queen Charlotte I., got 10.7 m, tore oil tanks from concrete bases and apparently took the life of a man. The tidal wave caused extensive damage at Weah Point near the village of Masset.</p><p>About 3.2 km north of Masset a number of logs were washed onto the road, which is there about 1.2 m above high water. At Tow Hill logs were moved that had been in the same position on the beach for a number of years. At the mouth of the Tlell River, where a tidal bore has been observed on occasion, noise as of a wave travelling up the river was heard during the night, and a small piece of arable land near the high water line was flooded and damaged.</p><p>No record of the tsunami wave is seen on the tide gauge records in Prince Rupert or in Tusu, on the west coast of the Queen Charlotte I. A check for a filed death certificate at the Dept. of Vital Statistics in Victoria reveals a man was indeed lost in the sea in the period March 28-30, 1963 but reported missing near Jedway, BC which is on the inside southern tip of Moresby I. just north of Cape St. James.</p><p>An interview with Mr. Edward Hartt of the Canadian Coast Guard at Seal Cove near Prince Rupert confirmed the early morning arrival of this approximately 5.5 m high wave (over the tide) at Langara Lighthouse where he was the lightkeeper at the time. The wave broke two large fuel tanks from their moorings at the lighthouse dock and deposited them ashore well above high water. Mr. Hartt felt the source of this large wave was probably from the southwest because of the areas where most the damage occurred around the lighthouse.</p><p>A disturbance was reported from Dixon Entrance region of the Queen Charlotte I. during the night of March 30-31. The wave heights reached from 3.7 to 5.5 m above high water and caused minor damage at Langara I., Wiah Point, and Port Simpson. The disturbance was not recorded by any tide gauge and was not reported from any other area. No correlation between this event and any seismic or atmospheric disturbance has been found.</p><p>The date reported by von Hake and Cloud [1965] is different to that reported in the Canadian newspapers but likely represents the same event. The report of minor damage at Port Simpson by VonHake and Cloud was not confirmed in the interviews of Port Simpson residents by the author. It is unfortunate that the lightkeepers records from other lighthouses nearer to Port Simpson during this period (March 1963) are no longer available to confirm any closer sightings of this unusual wave to Port Simpson. According to Mr. Ed. Hartt these records were destroyed when the coast Guard moved their offices from Prince Rupert to Seal Cove in 1972...</p><p>Stephenson [2003] resumes the information on this event as follows:<br />-If there was a tsunami, it was a local event generated by an underwater slump.<br />-This tsunami event was almost certainly smaller than any of the &#34;reported&#34; heights. From the report by Willie Rapatz it follows that the dislodged tanks were only about 0.3 m above the high water (HW) line, and the road which logs washed up onto was only about 1.2 m above the HW line.<br />-The reported 10 and 12 m waves were probably heights above chart datum, meaning that the maximum wave height was about 5.5 m.</p><p>(above from reference #4153)</p><p>1963, March 30/31. In British Columbia, at Wiah Point (Langara I.) and Port Simpson, the water rose. There was no earthquake; a doubtful tsunami (Reference #415).</p>"

On falling, the eject set fire to the island&#39;s vegetation which was dry at that time of year. The entire island was showered with bits of pumice, but an especially thick layer of ash and pumice covered the southwestern quadrant of the island, including the settlements there.

This eruption of Saint Augustine Volcano, producing a reported ashfall of up to 5 inches, was accompanied by a series of tsunamis.  The first wave may have been produced by the effect of the air wave from the eruption on the water, while the tsunami was the result of a debris avalanche from the collapse of the north face of the peak. An eyewitness account of the volcanic tsunami produced by the eruption was recorded in the daily log of the Alaska Commercial Company trading post at English Bay(Alaska Commercial Company, 1883): &#34;At this morning at 8:15 o&#39;dock, 4 tidal waves flowed with a westerly current, one following the other at the rate of 30 miles p. hour into the shore, the sea rising 20 feet aboye the usual level.&#34; Augustine Island, a nearly circular volcanic island that has had six significant eruptions in historical times, is surrounded by underwater deposits similar to that produced by this slide; tsunamis were probably generated repeatedly by this volcano in prehistorical times.  It is possible that there may have been Aleut casualties during this event (a search for five or six Aleut hunters camped on Augustine Island just prior to the eruption yielded nothing) but the descriptions are unclear; the <b>death designation here is conjectural</b>.\r\n<p>The tsunami was apparently generated by a debris avalanche from the collapse of the north face of the peak.

It swept in from the east at about 4 p.m. on the 8th ult., but fortunately broke on the Iiku or windward side of the island, the side which almost invariably is protected by a fiat shore-reef. An examination afterwards made of the liku showed that the waves had attained fully the height of 25ft above ordinary high water- mark, and had made a clean sweep of trees, shrubs, &amp;c., to that height along the coast for miles at the Iiku. Behind Faleloa -another town - the water had not risen quite as high, but had had strength enough to carry rocks five or six tons in weight from the lower beach, and to lift them up on to the top of an abrupt rise of 15ft or 20ft. At other points of the coast the waves had been destructive to perhaps the height of 15ft, sometimes washing away points of land and forming new beaches, as on the neighboring island of Lifuka, where the graveyards on the windward side of the island were swept away. It was a mercy, a correspondent says, that the waters rose no higher. Another 10ft of a rise and the whole of Foa -which is one of the highest of the islands - would have been under water, and on the lower and flatter islands the inhabitants must all have perished.\r\n(reference #11629)\r\n<p>The Tonga correspondent of the Suva Times writes from Haabai :-&#34; Doubts having been expressed as to the correctness of the estimate given by me in a former letter as to the height reached by tidal waves on the island of Fua during the gales of 7th and 8th March, accurate scientific measurement  by three gentlemen demonstrate that they reached the extraordinary height of 36ft. above ordinary high-water mark. The waves could not have been caused by the gale simply, which was merely a heavy blow from the S.E., but must have been created by earthquake or other upheaval some distance from the group. The waves inland during  the gale of 16th March, when all the ships of war at anchor in the harbour of Apia, Samoa,  were wrecked, are reported as reaching, on the island of Savaii, where the greatest damage on shore was done, to 15ft. above high-water mark only.&#34;(reference #11630)</p>"

This ebbing and flowing was observed 4 times.\u00a0<br />At Marazion the sea rushed from the south about 50 yards, to the height of 4 or 5 feet, and then retired to its former level.\u00a0<br />At Mousehole there was so great an agitation that one of the large fishing boats parted its hawser and was carried out of the pier.</p><p>Further references: Dawson (reference #2853)</p><p>(above from reference #4139)</p><p>&#34;An Account of an extraordinary Tide at Arbroath,&#34; by. Mr. Brown. The ordinary neap tide at Arbroath rises from eight to nine feet, but on July 5th, 1843, an extraordinary phenomenon occurred. The moon was in perihelion at 2 o&#39;clock, and the evening tide was suddenly raised, at the time of high water, to nine and a half or eleven feet-again sunk for about ten minutes, and was raised again, there being a series of fluxes and refluxes. It was not known whether the pbenomenon commenced with a rising or a depression, or with the horizontal length of the wave. The sea was perfectly calm, but vessels which were entering the port perceived a current stronger than usual. In the evening there was a violent thunder storm. Persons who had observed the appearance before, accounted for it on the supposition of a storm in the Atlantic from the suthwest.-Mr. Scott Russell thought the phenomenon at Abroath was not tidal at all. Similar phenomena had been observed elsewhere, on the coast of Scotland, and are described in the same manner. It is supposed by some that they are the consequences of the subsidence or elevation of the coast; others think that they arise from submarine volcanic explosions, and the undulations of the atmosphere which were observed after, would seem to strengthen this opinion. Mr. Hunt called attention to a peculiar condition of the tide on the 5th of July, at Mount&#39;s Bay, Cornwall. The tide had receded for about half an hour, when it was observed to flow again, and continued to do so for about ten minutes, when it again receded. This was three times repeated. It was observed that this took place over an extensive line of coast, from Land&#39;s End to Port Leaven. (reference #8078)</p>"

Solomon, a small settlement east of Nome, has been completely wiped out by terrible surf, which was accompanied by neither wind nor rain. The flooding of Nome is inexplicable. It is now announced that no storm occurred there, but that the flooding followed on a rush of the tide. It is probable that a volcanic disturbance took place in the seabed miles distant from Nome, and thus the abnormal tide was formed. In the rush of the tide schooners were driven ashore. If icebergs had been as far southward as usual they would have dashed against the buildings of the streets on the waterfront.

Great waves swept away the frail structures along the beach and carried many small coasting vessels far up on the beach. The flood came without warning. There was complete calm at the time, but the waves were of a giant size, as though raised by a hurricane. No reports of earthquakes have been received, but for several months Mount Bogosloff and Mount Shishalden, near Unemak pass, have been spouting fire and lava at short intervals, and the Bogosdloff lands have been undergoing peculiar contortions. Reports are anxiously awaited from other points along the coast. (reference #7595)\r\n</p><p>...I was born in Nome Alaska December 29th, 1904 on the Sand Spit.  We lived in a small cabin outside of Nome which was between the Bering Sea and the Snake River... Our father worked in a gold mine in Alaska.  He was injured by a falling bucket in the mine December 2nd, 1904 and died the next day.  Because of permafrost the body could not be buried deep and when a tidal wave came years later the graves were washed out and his body was found.  There was a write up of a dance hall girl in a well known magazine about her body being washed up and recognized.  (reference #7615)</p>"

When she did arrive at Nauru the mail could not be landed as, although the sea had calmed down and was like a mill pond, a most extraordinary series of tidal waves suddenly developed. One particularly high wave completely filled the boat harbour and sunk a launch and cargo lighter and ran inshore for about 150 yards further than any wave has been for more years. The tidal waves washed a lot of cook houses from Chinatown into the ocean. We suppose that the tidal disturbance was caused by some submarine movement of the ocean bed.&#34; (reference #9035)"

The land forming the high bluffs back of the boathouse is said to have sunk sixty feet perpendicular, forcing the beach and rocks strewn along it for a length of 1,800 feet some 30 feet upward and some 600 feet outward into the harbor. The change occurred on the 9th of March and the ground is reported to be still moving&#34; (<i>Los Angeles Sunday Times</i>, March 17, 1895, p. 15, vol. 4). Joy (1968) describes events on these dates giving the dates as March 8, 10, and 30 as &#34;A highly questionable series of events. A small schooner was wrecked while in the harbor on San Miguel Island, possibly a landslide triggered by an earthquake.&#34;\r\n<br />Townley and Allen (1939) cite an article in a newspaper of March 17 but did not identify it. They think the story was worked up by a newspaper reported into a very sensational story. There was no mention of the events in the <i>Santa Barbara Free Press</i> of March 10 to 12 or March 31 to April 1. The <i>Santa Barbara Daily Independent</i>, the apparent source of these reports, could not be located for March.\r\n<br /><i>The Daily Independent</i> for April 2 states, &#34;News must be very scarce in Santa Barbara when the correspondents of outside papers have to resort to fakes, pure and simple, to make their daily budget...&#34;\r\n<br />Costa Harbor can not be located. The only harbor on the island is Cuyler&#39;s Harbor and has been known as that since 1852. The initial <i>Los Angeles Sunday Times</i> report seems like a very detailed description of a large coastal land slide of a rotational type, pushing its toe upward and outwards...The description of the noise, the visible and sensible effects of the shock on the vessel and the &#34;disturbed&#34; water would  be consistent for alarge subaerial landslide into the water with or without a triggering earthquake if the vessel were near shore. It could be a belated report of the event of March 9 or a continuation of the landsliding at a later date.\r\n<br />A landslide into the ocean could generate a local tsunami if it had occurred rapidly as the &#34;noise&#34; would suggest. However, there is nothing in these descriptions to suggest a wave beyond the &#34;disturbance&#34; of the water. Validity 2.\r\n<br />above from reference #237.\r\n</p><p>1895, March 8/10 or 30.

The subsequent earthquakes were, in his opinion, the result of interior explosions of the steam thus generated, and the final eruption that has devastated the Santa Maria region is ascribed to a last gigantic effort of this imprisoned vapor to burst its fetters. On September 27 a tidal wave rolled in upon the coast of\r\nGuatemala, concentrating upon the shore at Ocos, north of Champerico, where it destroyed the pier and washed away the beach, tearing the ocean bed to a depth of seven fathoms, where the lead had previously sounded only five fathoms. The course of the river at Ocos was diverted, and now flows into the harbor close to the town, a considerable distance from its original point of entrance. (reference #7815)"

This English adventurer stayed in the Marquesas archipelago from 1798 to 1806 and married a daughter of a chief to Nuku Hiva, who allowed him to integrate with the Marquesan society. What is said here confirms the end of the preceding paragraph: de Cato, and some others have informed me that the sea, several times in the course of time, has risen four or five feet above its normal level, and has come rolling. in a heavy wave through the grass and bushes. It remained for a short time, and then suddenly retreated, leaving a good quantity of fish through the grass and bushes ... These sudden overflows of the sea occurred twenty or thirty years ago. This, I think, is very singular because I had never heard that the sea could rise so suddenly in any part of the world. (Demming page 242)\r\n</p><p>Robarts having left the archipelago in 1806, it can be supposed that it was after his departure that a tsunami occurred which destroyed the bread trees and the food resources of the low valleys at Nuku Hiva. Encouraging people to attempt a last migration or nearly eight hundred people disappeared in pursuit of the setting sun. Dr. Rollin located this catastrophe between 1804 and 1806.

        "comments": "1979, July 18. A strong tsunami occurred in Indonesia. According to the preliminary data, a tsunami with a height of 7-9 m was observed on Lomblen island (8<sup>o</sup> S., Lat, 123<sup>o</sup> 30&#39; W. Long). In four villages <b>539 people lost their lives and 700 were declared missing</b>. Water covered the land to a distance of 1,500 m. The possible reasons for the generation of the tsunami were the eruption of a volcano, a landslide, or the falling of part of the mountain peak, into the sea. An earthquake is ruled out. At first it was erroneously thought that the tsunami was generated by a volcanic eruption. This misperception was due to an incorrect translation from the Indonesian language.\r\n<p>It was later concluded that the cause of the tsunami was a landslide on one of the capes on the southern coast of Lomblen Island. The settlements of Waiteba, located at the neck of the cape on the eastern side of the cape, and Labala-Mulang on the western side suffered the most. The tsunami started with the sea receding from the coast and then returned with tremendous force. Mainly villagers rather than fishermen suffered. </p><p>(above from reference 417)\r\n</p><p>1979, July 18. Sources from the daily newspapers &#34;Kompas&#34; and &#34;Suara Karya&#34; of Indonesia stated that the tsunami waves that occurred on July 18, 1979 at approximately 1:00 A.M. (local time) in Indonesia swept up the coastal area 500 meters inland and over hills that were 10 meters high. The tsunami originated from an area which is at 8 deg 32 min S - 123 deg 30 min E, on the southern coast of Lembata Island.\r\nThe waves deposited 2 meters thick of sand on coastal settlements. A total of 187 persons were killed, most of them found buried under the sand, 32 persons were seriously injured, and 364 persons were missing. The 3 villages (Labala, Waiteba and Bobu), with population totalling 3,422, were completely obliterated. According to the Smithsonian Institution&#39;s SEAN Bulletin of July 31, 1979, the meteorology and geophysics station at Kupang recorded an earthquake of undetermined magnitude at 00:42 local time on 18 July, located in the Sawu Sea (south of Lomblen). Light rocks, dead fishes, and oil film were found floating on the coastal waters, days after the tsunami. The coastline shifted 20 meters inland. The sites where a school, a health centre and a government building were located, are now under the sea. (Reference #3330)\r\n</p><p>1979, July 17 [18]. A tsunami generated by a landslide struck the south coast of Lomblen Island, Lesser Sunda Islands, Indonesia. The landslide, which occurred on the south coast of Lembata Island,was possibly triggered by a small earthquake in the Sawu Sea. Four villages on Lomblen were destroyed with 187 killed and 364 missing. (Reference #45)</p>",

The reported number of fatalities associated with this event that occurred between April and June 1781 is inconsistent between all entries. Three out of four entries that record this event provide details of a tsunami. The death of one woman was reported in 2 entries with reference made to &#34;Taiwan interview catalogue&#34; (Chen et al., 1830). In contrast, Yang (1987) recorded &gt;50 000 deaths associated with a tsunami caused by a Taiwan Strait earthquake in May. In citing &gt;50 000 deaths Yang also quoted descriptions from Chen et al. (1830). The death toll reported for this event appears erroneous since it is not cited in the detailed publications of Soloviev and Go (1974), and Zhou and Adam (1986). However, the inclusion of the 1781 tsunami-like event into the work of Yang (1987) has been generally accepted and this &#34;deadly&#34; tsunami report is now widely quoted among Chinese literatures (e.g. Wang and Bao, 1992; Ye et al., 2005). </p><p>The Yang (1987) record of the 1781 April-June event (#14) is possibly the best example of how erroneous reporting can arise when including information from previous publications.

The descriptions are similar to those for the 22 May 1782 event (#15) recorded for Taiwan by Iida et al. (1967) and Soloviev and Go (1974).

The flood was reported to last for a few quarters, which is a typical period of a tsunami. Based on conditions 1 and 2 (see Sect. 4.1.1 and 4.1.2), this event is sufficient to be validated as tsunami. The weather was reported to be fine, eliminating the possibility of a storm surge. No earthquake was reported in the region in this period, suggesting that the tsunami was probably not tectonic in origin. The run-up was reported both quantitatively (tens of zhangs) and qualitatively (about a bamboo high). One woman was reported to be drowned. The reporter&#39;s name was also recorded, which was not a common practice in local historiographies, giving support to the reliability of the report. The event was not recorded in the official dynastic record, possibly because the damage was minor. This event is the only tsunami with explicit damage (one life and several huts) in South China in the history.</p>"
